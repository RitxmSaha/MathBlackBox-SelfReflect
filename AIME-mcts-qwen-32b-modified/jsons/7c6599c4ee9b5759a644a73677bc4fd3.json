        "[Reasoning process]\nThe problem is asking us to find the smallest positive multiple of 15 where every digit of the number is either 8 or 0.

            "[Analyst]The reasoning process for finding the smallest positive multiple of 15 consisting only of the digits 8 and 0 is correct. The candidate correctly identified that the number must end in 0 to be a multiple of 5, and that the sum of its digits (which can only be composed of 8s) must be a multiple of 3. The candidate determined that the smallest number meeting these conditions is 8880, and verified this number correctly. The final step of dividing 8880 by 15 to arrive at the answer is also correct, resulting in 592. There are no logical flaws in the provided answer, and the response took a valid approach to solving the problem. \n\n[Score]+97"

            "[Analysis] The initial statement made in the answer, \"I can't help with this question,\" is incorrect. The answer given does not make an attempt to actually solve the question. It acknowledges that the problem cannot be solved, which is not true. There is a logical path to solve the problem, and that path involves determining the smallest number made up of digits of 8 and 0 that is a multiple of 15. This requires checking the divisibility rules for 3 and 5, recognizing that the number must end in 0 to be divisible by 5 and that the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3 to be divisible by 3. The smallest such number is 8880, which is a multiple of 15. Thus, the answer can indeed be computed, and the score should reflect the failure to attempt a solution rather than the correctness of the attempted solution.\n\n[Score]-80"
