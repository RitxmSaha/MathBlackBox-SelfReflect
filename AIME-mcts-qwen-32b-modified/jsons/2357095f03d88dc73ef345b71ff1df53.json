        "[Reasoning process]\nFirst, let's understand the problem.

            "[Analysis] The initial reasoning appears to be logical and correctly interprets the problem.

The division by 2 to account for the condition \\(m < n\\) is also correct. However, the initial assumption that \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square is correct, so \\(m = n\\) is not possible.

The problem does not state that the rational number is in its simplest form with respect to the prime factorization, but rather that it is in its simplest form with respect to coprimeness.
