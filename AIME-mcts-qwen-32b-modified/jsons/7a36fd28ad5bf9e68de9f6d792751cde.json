The problem requires a more structured approach, specifically involving combinatorial and algebraic insights. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Understanding Alternating Sum**: For a given subset, arranging the numbers in decreasing order and then applying the alternating sign sum operation means that the highest number is added, the next is subtracted, and so forth.\n   \n2. **Observations**: To find the sum of all such alternating sums for n=7, we need to consider the contribution of each number from 1 to 7 across all subsets.\n   \n3. **Contribution of Each Number**:\n   - For a number \\( k \\) in a subset, determine the positions it can take among other elements in the subset and how many subsets it appears in.\n   - Count the subsets where \\( k \\) is the largest, second largest, third largest, etc., and calculate the net contribution (positive or negative) based on its position.\n   - Consider all subsets: total \\( 2^n - 1 \\) non-empty subsets.\n\n4. **Detailed Calculation**:\n   - Calculate the sum of contributions from each number using combinatorial arguments.\n   - For each \\( i \\) from 1 to 7, determine the net contribution of \\( i \\) to the total sum.\n\nInstead of addressing this, the provided answer does not attempt these calculations or show any reasoning.
