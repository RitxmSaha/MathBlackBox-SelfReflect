Let’s consider the polynomial division of \\( n^3 + 100 \\) by \\( n + 10 \\):\n\nFirst, rewrite \\( n^3 + 100 \\) in a form that reveals the relationship:\n\\[ n^3 + 100 = (n + 10)(n^2 - 10n + 100) - 900. \\]\n\nThis equation comes from long division of polynomials. Essentially, when \\( n + 10 \\) is a factor of \\( n^3 + 100 \\), the remainder (which is \\(-900\\)) must be zero or divisible by \\( n + 10 \\). Since it's a constant, the only way for \\( n + 10 \\) to divide \\(-900\\) is for \\( n + 10 \\) to be a divisor of 900.\n\nThus, \\( n + 10 \\) must be one of the divisors of 900. To find the largest \\( n \\), we need the largest divisor of 900 and subtract 10 from it:\n\\[ n = \\text{largest divisor of } 900 - 10. \\]\n\nFirst, identify the divisors of 900: \n\\[ 900 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2. \\]\nThe largest divisor of 900 is 900 itself. So:\n\\[ n = 900 - 10 = 890. \\]\n\nLet’s verify that 890 works: \\( n + 10 = 890 + 10 = 900 \\), and if this is a factor of \\( 890^3 + 100 \\), it confirms our answer.\n\n[Verification]\n\nCheck if \\( 900 \\) divides \\( 890^3 + 100 \\). According to our earlier setup:\n\\[ n^3 + 100 = (n + 10)(n^2 - 10n + 100) - 900. \\]\nFor \\( n = 890 \\):\n\\[ 890^3 + 100 = 900(890^2 - 10 \\cdot 890 + 100) - 900. \\]\nSince \\( 900 \\) divides the first part \\( 900(890^2 - 10 \\cdot 890 + 100) \\), we need to ensure the second part is cancelled out:\n\\[ 890^3 + 100 \\equiv -900 \\pmod{900}. \\]\nSo indeed, \\( 900 \\) divides \\( 890^3 + 100 \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\( 890 \\)\n\n#### 890"
