However, we can infer that the response indicates a lack of understanding or approach to solving the problem, which involves finding the probability that a randomly chosen positive divisor of \\(10^{99}\\) is an integer multiple of \\(10^{88}\\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the problem.

If a number \\(N = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}\\), the number of divisors \\(d(N)\\) is:\n\\[\nd(N) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\n\\]\n\nFor \\(10^{99}\\):\n\\[\nd(10^{99}) = (99 + 1)(99 + 1) = 100 \\cdot 100 = 10000\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find how many of these divisors are multiples of \\(10^{88}\\).
