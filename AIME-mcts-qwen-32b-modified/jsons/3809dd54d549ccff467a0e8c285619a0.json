            "[Analysis] The answer determined by the code is 119, which corresponds to solving 23 problems correctly and getting 2 problems wrong. The reasoning process to arrive at this answer appears to be correct in terms of identifying the unique score. However, there is a need to verify if 119 is indeed the correct and smallest score over 80 for which there is a unique combination of correct and wrong answers, and any lower score (still over 80) has multiple possible combinations.\n\nLet's manually verify the reasoning:\n\n1. The score formula is \\( s = 30 + 4c - w \\).\n2. For \\( s = 119 \\):\n   \\[\n   119 = 30 + 4c - w \\implies 89 = 4c - w\n   \\]\n   The only integer solution for \\( 0 \\leq c \\leq 30 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq w \\leq 30 - c \\) is \\( c = 23 \\) and \\( w = 2 \\). Hence, the combination (23, 2) is unique for \\( s = 119 \\).\n\n3. Now, let's check if any lower score (over 80) has multiple combinations. For example, for \\( s = 118 \\):\n   \\[\n   118 = 30 + 4c - w \\implies 88 = 4c - w\n   \\]\n   Possible combinations for \\( c \\) and \\( w \\) are (23, 3) and (22, 4), which means there are multiple possible combinations for \\( s = 118 \\).\n\n4. Let's check for \\( s = 117 \\):\n   \\[\n   117 = 30 + 4c - w \\implies 87 = 4c - w\n   \\]\n   Possible combinations for \\( c \\) and \\( w \\) are (23, 5) and (22, 3), which means there are multiple possible combinations for \\( s = 117 \\).\n\nWe can see that for these lower scores, there are multiple combinations of \\( c \\) and \\( w \\). Therefore, the score 119 indeed is the smallest score over 80 for which there is a unique combination of correct and wrong answers, and any lower score (still over 80) has multiple possible combinations.\n\nThe code logic and the verification method both confirm that the unique score is 119.

            "Question: Mary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$ . From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$ , John could not have determined this. What was Mary's score? (Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$ , is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$ , where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers. Students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.)\nThe response should begin with [reasoning process]...[Verification]... and end with \"[Final Answer] The answer is [number] \\n#### [number]\"\nLet's think step by step.",
