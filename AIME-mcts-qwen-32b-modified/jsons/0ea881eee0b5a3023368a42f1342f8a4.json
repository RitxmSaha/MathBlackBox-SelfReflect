The question asks for the number of distinct convex polygons that can be formed using some or all of ten points marked on a circle as vertices. To solve this problem, one needs to recognize that any subset of three or more points chosen from the ten points will form a convex polygon because the points are on a circle.

        "[Reasoning process] To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct convex polygons of three or more sides that can be formed from ten points marked on a circle. \n\nFirst, note that every subset of the ten points that includes three or more points will form a convex polygon because the points are on a circle. Therefore, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose subsets of these points where the number of points in each subset is at least three.\n\nThe number of ways to choose \\(k\\) points out of 10 is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{10}{k}\\). We need to sum these for \\(k = 3\\) to \\(k = 10\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of polygons} = \\sum_{k=3}^{10} \\binom{10}{k}\n\\]\n\nInstead of calculating each term separately, we can use the property of binomial coefficients that the sum of all binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) (in this case, 10) is \\(2^n\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} = 2^{10}\n\\]\n\nThis total includes the empty set and the sets that have 0, 1, and 2 points. We need to subtract these cases since we are only interested in polygons with 3 or more points:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=3}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} = 2^{10} - \\binom{10}{0} - \\binom{10}{1} - \\binom{10}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\[\n2^{10} = 1024, \\quad \\binom{10}{0} = 1, \\quad \\binom{10}{1} = 10, \\quad \\binom{10}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=3}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} = 1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 = 968\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can compute the sum of specific binomial coefficients:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{3} + \\binom{10}{4} + \\binom{10}{5} + \\binom{10}{6} + \\binom{10}{7} + \\binom{10}{8} + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10}\n\\]\n\nThese can be individually calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{3} = 120, \\quad \\binom{10}{4} = 210, \\quad \\binom{10}{5} = 252, \\quad \\binom{10}{6} = 210, \\quad \\binom{10}{7} = 120, \\quad \\binom{10}{8} = 45, \\quad \\binom{10}{9} = 10, \\quad \\binom{10}{10} = 1\n\\]\n\nAdding these:\n\n\\[\n120 + 210 + 252 + 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 968\n\\]\n\nThe verification confirms our result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 968\n#### 968"
