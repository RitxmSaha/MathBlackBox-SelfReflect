If we consider the binary representation of numbers and replace each 1 with a 3 in the place value, we can see a direct correspondence between the sequence and the binary numbers.\n\nFor instance:\n- Binary 1 corresponds to 3^0 = 1 (decimal 1)\n- Binary 10 corresponds to 3^1 = 3 (decimal 3)\n- Binary 11 corresponds to 3^1 + 3^0 = 3 + 1 = 4 (decimal 4)\n- Binary 100 corresponds to 3^2 = 9 (decimal 9)\n- Binary 101 corresponds to 3^2 + 3^0 = 9 + 1 = 10 (decimal 10)\n- Binary 110 corresponds to 3^2 + 3^1 = 9 + 3 = 12 (decimal 12)\n- Binary 111 corresponds to 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 (decimal 13)\n\nMore generally, the nth term of the sequence corresponds to the number represented in base 3 where the digits are binary digits (either 0 or 1). So, to find the 100th term, we first need to determine the binary representation of 100.\n\nThe binary form of 100 is 1100100. By treating this binary number as representing powers of 3, we get:\n\\[ 1100100_2 = 1\\cdot3^6 + 1\\cdot3^5 + 0\\cdot3^4 + 0\\cdot3^3 + 1\\cdot3^2 + 0\\cdot3^1 + 0\\cdot3^0 \\]\n\\[ = 3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 \\]\n\\[ = 729 + 243 + 9 \\]\n\\[ = 981 \\]\n\nSo, the 100th term of the sequence is 981.\n\n[Verification]... Let's verify this by generating the sequence up to the 100th term programmatically.\n```python\ndef generate_sequence(n):\n    sequence = []\n    i = 1\n    while len(sequence) < n:\n        binary_representation = bin(i)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove the '0b' prefix\n        term = sum(3**j for j, bit in enumerate(reversed(binary_representation)) if bit == '1')\n        sequence.append(term)\n        i += 1\n    return sequence\n\n# Generate the first 100 terms of the sequence\nsequence = generate_sequence(100)\n# The 100th term is the last term in the generated sequence\nhundredth_term = sequence[99]\nprint(hundredth_term)\n```\n```output\n981\n```\n[Final Answer] The answer is 981 \n#### 981"
