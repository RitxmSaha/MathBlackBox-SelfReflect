        "[Reasoning process]\nLet the probability of getting heads in one flip be \\( p \\). Then the probability of getting tails in one flip is \\( 1 - p \\). We can express the probabilities of getting exactly one head and exactly two heads in five flips using the binomial probability formula:\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly } k \\text{ heads}) = \\binom{5}{k} p^k (1-p)^{5-k} \\]\nSo, the probability of getting exactly one head is:\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 1 head}) = \\binom{5}{1} p^1 (1-p)^4 = 5p(1-p)^4 \\]\nAnd the probability of getting exactly two heads is:\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 2 heads}) = \\binom{5}{2} p^2 (1-p)^3 = 10p^2(1-p)^3 \\]\nAccording to the problem, these probabilities are equal:\n\\[ 5p(1-p)^4 = 10p^2(1-p)^3 \\]\nWe can simplify this equation:\n\\[ 5p(1-p)^4 = 10p^2(1-p)^3 \\]\n\\[ 5p(1-p) = 10p^2 \\]\n\\[ 5(1-p) = 10p \\]\n\\[ 5 - 5p = 10p \\]\n\\[ 5 = 15p \\]\n\\[ p = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\nSo, the probability of getting heads in one flip is \\( p = \\frac{1}{3} \\), and the probability of getting tails is \\( 1 - p = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of getting exactly three heads in five flips. Using the binomial probability formula:\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 3 heads}) = \\binom{5}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 3 heads}) = 10 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 3 heads}) = 10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{27} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 3 heads}) = 10 \\cdot \\frac{4}{243} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 3 heads}) = \\frac{40}{243} \\]\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{40}{243}\\) is already in its lowest terms, so \\( i = 40 \\) and \\( j = 243 \\). Thus, \\( i + j = 40 + 243 = 283 \\).\n\n[Verification]\nWe have verified the calculations by first finding the value of \\( p \\) from the equality of probabilities and then using that value to find the required probability of getting exactly three heads in five flips. The final fraction \\(\\frac{40}{243}\\) is confirmed to be in its lowest terms.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\( 283 \\)\n#### 283"
