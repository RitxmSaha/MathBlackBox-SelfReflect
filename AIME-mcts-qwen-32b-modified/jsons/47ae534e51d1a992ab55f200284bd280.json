        "[Reasoning process]...To find the largest positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n! \\) can be expressed as the product of \\( n - 3 \\) consecutive positive integers, we start by noting examples and establishments of the pattern. We know one case already: \\( 6! = 8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 10 \\). Here, \\( 6 \\) fits the condition \\( n = 6 \\) meaning it's the product of \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\) consecutive integers. \n\nLet's denote the product of \\( n-3 \\) consecutive integers as:\n\\[ P = k(k+1)(k+2) \\cdots (k + n - 4), \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is the first of these \\( n-3 \\) consecutive integers.
