        "### Reasoning Process:\n\nTo find the probability that heads never occur on consecutive tosses in 10 coin tosses, we need to count the valid sequences where no two heads occur consecutively, and divide this count by the total number of possible sequences.\n\n1. **Total number of sequences**:\n   Since each coin toss has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), there are \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) possible sequences for 10 coin tosses.\n\n2. **Counting valid sequences**:\n   Define \\(a_n\\) as the number of valid sequences of length \\(n\\).
