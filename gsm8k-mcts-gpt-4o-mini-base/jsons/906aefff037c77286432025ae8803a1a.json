        "[reasoning process] Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2 of them. To determine how many lollipops Jean has left, we can subtract the number of lollipops eaten from the original amount:\n\n30 lollipops - 2 lollipops = 28 lollipops remaining.\n\nNext, Jean wants to package the remaining 28 lollipops, putting 2 lollipops into each bag. To find out how many bags can be filled, we divide the number of lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag:\n\n28 lollipops ÷ 2 lollipops per bag = 14 bags.\n\nThus, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.\n\n[Verification] To verify this calculation, let's go back through the steps. First, we confirmed that after eating 2 lollipops, Jean had 28 lollipops left. Then, when dividing 28 by 2 for the bags, we checked that 14 is indeed the correct answer since 14 bags times 2 lollipops per bag equals 28 lollipops.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14 \\n#### 14",
