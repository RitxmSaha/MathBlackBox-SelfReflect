        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are produced by Lloyd's chickens per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the daily production in dozens by dividing the total number of eggs produced per day by 12.\n\nDaily production in dozens = 252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens\n\nNext, we find out how much money Lloyd makes per day by selling these eggs. Since he sells each dozen for $2, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.\n\nDaily earnings = 21 dozens × $2 per dozen = $42\n\nTo find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days).\n\nWeekly earnings = $42 per day × 7 days = $294\n\n[Verification] We calculated the number of dozens of eggs produced each day as 21, and then calculated daily earnings as $42. After multiplying by 7 days, we confirmed that the weekly earnings are indeed $294. All calculations have been checked for accuracy.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $294 \\n#### 294",
