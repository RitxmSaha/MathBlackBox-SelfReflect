        "[reasoning process] Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. To find out how many flowers he has planted after 15 days, we multiply the number of flowers he plants per day by the number of days: 2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers planted in total. However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find out how many flowers are actually growing in his garden, we need to subtract the flowers that did not grow from the total flowers planted: 30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers growing.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct, let's re-evaluate the steps: \n1. Ryan plants 2 flowers each day for 15 days, which gives us 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.\n2. He has 5 flowers that did not grow.\n3. We then take the total 30 flowers and deduct the 5 that did not grow: 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.\n\nThe calculations have been reviewed, and all steps are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
