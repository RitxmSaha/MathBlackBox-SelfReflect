        "[Reasoning process] First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches since the pieces are being cut in inches. We know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. Therefore, a 4-foot length of wire is:\n\n4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the 48 inches of wire. To find this, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:\n\n48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by performing the division again:\n\n48 ÷ 6 = 8. \n\nTo further confirm, we can multiply the number of pieces by the length of each piece:\n\n8 pieces * 6 inches/piece = 48 inches.\n\nSince this matches the original length of the wire, our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 pieces \\n#### 8",
