        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we determine Alex's weight based on the information given. Grace weighs 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. We can express this mathematically as:\n\n1. Calculate 4 times Grace's weight:\n   \\( 4 \\times 125 = 500 \\) pounds.\n\n2. Now, subtract 2 pounds from this amount to find Alex's weight:\n   \\( 500 - 2 = 498 \\) pounds.\n\nNext, we need to find the combined weight of Grace and Alex:\n3. Combine their weights:\n   \\( 125 + 498 = 623 \\) pounds.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations step by step:\n- Calculating 4 times Grace's weight:\n   \\( 4 \\times 125 = 500 \\) is correct.\n- Then, subtracting 2 pounds gives us:\n   \\( 500 - 2 = 498 \\) is also correct.\n- Finally, combining their weights:\n   \\( 125 + 498 = 623 \\) is verified and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 623 \n#### 623",
