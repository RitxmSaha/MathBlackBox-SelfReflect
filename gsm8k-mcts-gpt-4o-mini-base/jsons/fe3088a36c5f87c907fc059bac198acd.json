    "ground_truth": "First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours\nNext subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour\nNow figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles\nNow divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph\n#### 6",

        "[Reasoning Process] First, let's find out how much distance Marissa has left and how much time she has remaining to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.\n\n1. **Total Distance**: 12 miles\n2. **Average Speed Goal**: 4 miles per hour\n3. **Total Time for Average Speed**: To find the total time it should take to walk 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Average Speed}} = \\frac{12 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ miles/hour}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Time So Far**: Marissa walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in another hour, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent} = 1 \\text{ hour} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Time Remaining**: The time she has left to complete the hike is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time Remaining} = \\text{Total Time} - \\text{Time spent} = 3 \\text{ hours} - 2 \\text{ hours} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Distance Remaining**: She has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles), so the distance remaining is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance Remaining} = 12 \\text{ miles} - 6 \\text{ miles} = 6 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Required Speed for Remaining Distance**: To find out what speed she needs to walk to cover the remaining 6 miles in the 1 hour she has left, we use the formula for speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{6 \\text{ miles}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 6 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] Thus, we have calculated that Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour for the next hour in order to complete the 12-mile hike in the desired total time of 3 hours.
