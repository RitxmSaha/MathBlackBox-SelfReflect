        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of pieces of pie Grandma Jones baked. She made 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pieces:\n\nTotal pieces = Number of pies × Pieces per pie  \nTotal pieces = 5 × 8 = 40 pieces\n\nNext, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining on the table. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we can subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:\n\nPieces taken = Total pieces - Remaining pieces  \nPieces taken = 40 - 14 = 26 pieces\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can check our calculations:\n\n1. Total number of pieces baked: 5 pies × 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces (correct).\n2. Pieces remaining: 14 (given).\n3.
