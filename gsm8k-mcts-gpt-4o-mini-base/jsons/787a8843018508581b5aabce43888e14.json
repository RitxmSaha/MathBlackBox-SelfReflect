        "[reasoning process] First, we note that the first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. To find the number of instructions in the second recipe, we can multiply the number of instructions in the first recipe by 2. \n\nThus, for the second recipe:  \nInstructions in second recipe = 2 * 20 = 40 instructions. \n\nNext, we need to find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare both dishes. We do this by adding the number of instructions from both recipes together. \n\nTotal instructions = Instructions in first recipe + Instructions in second recipe  \nTotal instructions = 20 + 40 = 60 instructions. \n\n[Verification] We calculated the number of instructions in each recipe correctly. The first recipe has 20 instructions. For the second recipe, we confirmed that doubling the 20 instructions gives us 40. Adding 20 and 40 equals 60, which is consistent and correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 \\n#### 60",
