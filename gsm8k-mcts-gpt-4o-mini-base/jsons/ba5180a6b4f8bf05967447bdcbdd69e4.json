    "ground_truth": "The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.\nIf every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.\nSo for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.\nAnd for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.\n#### 64",
