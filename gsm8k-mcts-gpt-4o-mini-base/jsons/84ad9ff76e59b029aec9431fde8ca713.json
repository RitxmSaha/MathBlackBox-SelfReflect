    "ground_truth": "A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.\nSo, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.\nThe total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.\nThus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.\n#### 255",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to find out the total cost of the five cell phones. Each cell phone costs $150, so:\n\nTotal cost of cell phones = 5 phones * $150/phone = $750.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the interest charged for each phone. The interest rate is 2%.
