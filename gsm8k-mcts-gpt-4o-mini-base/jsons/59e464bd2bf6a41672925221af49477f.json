    "query": "Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?",
    "ground_truth": "First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10\nThen add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12\nNow we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18\n#### 18",

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Left after red house} = \\frac{2x}{3} - 2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the amount sold at the orange house is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sold at orange house} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right)\n   \\]\n\n5. The number of vacuum cleaners left after all the sales can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining = Initial - Sold at green - Sold at red - Sold at orange}\n   \\]\n   So we write this as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining} = x - \\frac{x}{3} - 2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right) = 5\n   \\]\n\n6. Now substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   = x - \\frac{x}{3} - 2 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} \\right) - 1 \\right) = 5\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x - \\frac{x}{3} - 2 - \\left( \\frac{x}{3} - 1 \\right) = 5\n   \\]\n   Which further simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x - \\frac{x}{3} - \\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5\n   \\]\n   Combining the terms gives:\n   \\[\n   x - \\frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5\n   \\]\n   This leads to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5\n   \\]\n   Adding 1 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} = 6\n   \\]\n   Multiplying both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   x = 18\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\nNow, let's verify if Melanie indeed has 5 vacuum cleaners left with \\( x = 18 \\):\n- Sold at green house: \\( \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\), remaining: \\( 18 - 6 = 12 \\)\n- Sold at red house: \\( 2 \\), remaining: \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\)\n- Sold at orange house: \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\), remaining: \\( 10 - 5 = 5 \\)\n\nSince everything checks out, we confirm that Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18 \\n#### 18"
