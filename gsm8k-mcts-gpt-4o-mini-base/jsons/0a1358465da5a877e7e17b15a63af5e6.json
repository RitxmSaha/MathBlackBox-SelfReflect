        "[reasoning process] \nLet's start by breaking down the information given in the problem. We have:\n\n1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. \n   - If we denote Jackson's age as J, then Amy's age (A) can be represented as:\n   A = J + 5\n\n2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. \n   - This implies that Corey (C) is:\n   C = A + 2\n   Substituting A from the first equation:\n   C = (J + 5) + 2 = J + 7\n\n3. James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey.\n   - This means Corey is:\n   C = 10 + 1 = 11\n\nNow we have Corey’s age:\n- C = 11\n\nWe can substitute C back into the equation we derived earlier:\nJ + 7 = 11\n\nTo find Jackson's age (J), we solve the equation:\nJ = 11 - 7 \nJ = 4\n\nSo, Jackson is 4 years old.\n\n[Verification]\nLet’s verify our findings with the relationships given:\n- Jackson is 4, so Amy is J + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9.\n- Corey, based on Amy, is A + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11, which is consistent as we also found Corey to be 11 based on James.\n- Finally, James is 10, which is 1 year younger than Corey (11), confirming all ages are consistent with the relationships described.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
