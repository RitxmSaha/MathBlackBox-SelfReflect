        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine the number of cats in the neighborhood. We know that there are two cats for every dog, and since the number of dogs is given as 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cats} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of dogs} = 2 \\times 60 = 120\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of dogs and cats combined:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of dogs and cats} = \\text{Number of dogs} + \\text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180\n\\]\n\nNow, according to the problem statement, the number of rabbit pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
