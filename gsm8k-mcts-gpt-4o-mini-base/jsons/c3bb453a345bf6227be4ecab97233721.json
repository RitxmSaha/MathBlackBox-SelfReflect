        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find out how many teachers are at Dr. Wertz's school, we first need to determine the total number of students. We know that there are 60 girls at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:\n\nNumber of boys = 2 * Number of girls = 2 * 60 = 120 boys.\n\nNext, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls together:\n\nTotal number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys = 60 + 120 = 180 students.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of teachers. The problem states that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:\n\nNumber of teachers = Total number of students / Students per teacher = 180 / 5 = 36 teachers.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify our calculations and logic:\n1. We confirmed that there are 60 girls.\n2. We calculated the number of boys to be 120 based on the ratio provided (twice as many boys as girls).\n3. We summed the boys and girls to get a total of 180 students.\n4. Finally, we divided the total number of students by the number of students per teacher (5) to find that there are indeed 36 teachers.\n\nThe calculations and logic align, confirming our earlier result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36  \n#### 36",
