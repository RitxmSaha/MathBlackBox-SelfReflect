        "[reasoning process] To determine the final cost of grooming after applying the discount, we need to first find out the amount of the discount from the original cost. The original grooming cost is $100, and the groomer offers a 30% discount. \n\nTo calculate the discount, we multiply the original cost by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal):\n\n30% as a decimal is 0.30.\nSo, the discount amount is:\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.30 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final cost:\n\n\\[\n100 - 30 = 70 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations again.
