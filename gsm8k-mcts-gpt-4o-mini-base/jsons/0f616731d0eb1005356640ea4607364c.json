The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?",
    "ground_truth": "The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.\nThe third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times the third time.\nIn all, Greg’s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.\n#### 22",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of times the alarm rang throughout the day, we need to break down each instance the alarm went off:\n\n1. When the alarm first went off, it rang 4 times.\n2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first. This means if the first ringing consisted of 4 rings, then the second ringing would consist of:\n   - 3 times the first: \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) rings.\n3. The third time the alarm rang for half as long as the second time. Thus, the number of rings for the third time would be:\n   - Half of the second: \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\) rings.\n\nNext, we can add up all the rings from each occasion:\n- First time: 4 rings\n- Second time: 12 rings\n- Third time: 6 rings\n\nNow, summing these gives:\n\\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \\]\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the number of rings as follows:\n- First: 4 rings\n- Second: \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) rings\n- Third: \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\) rings\n\nAdding these rings together:\n\\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \\]\n\nThus, the calculations are consistent and accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 22 \\n#### 22",
