    "ground_truth": "The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension\nSo each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width\nIt also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height\nFinally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth\nSo the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches\nSo in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches\n#### 72",

        "[reasoning process] To calculate the total inner volume of the boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box after accounting for the thickness of the walls. Each box has an outer dimension of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. \n\n1. For the length (5 inches):\n   - Inner length = 5 inches (outer length) - 2 * 1 inch (thickness on both sides) = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches.\n\n2. For the width (6 inches):\n   - Inner width = 6 inches (outer width) - 2 * 1 inch (thickness on both sides) = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches.\n\n3. For the height (4 inches):\n   - Inner height = 4 inches (outer height) - 2 * 1 inch (thickness on both sides) = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches.\n\nNow, the inner dimensions of one box are 3 inches (length) by 4 inches (width) by 2 inches (height). \n\nNext, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for volume (length × width × height):\n- Volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.\n\nSince John has 3 identical boxes, we find the total inner volume by multiplying the volume of one box by the number of boxes:\n- Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches.\n\n[Verification] We verified the inner dimensions by subtracting the thickness of the walls from the outer dimensions of the boxes and calculated the volume accordingly. The mathematical operations were executed step by step, ensuring clarity in the calculation. All calculations align with standard volume formulas correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 72 \\n#### 72",
