He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much potato salad is required for the adults and children. Each adult dinosaur consumes 10 lbs of potato salad, and with 20 adults, the total consumption by adults will be:\n\n20 adults × 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.\n\nNext, we calculate the consumption for the children. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, we find that each child consumes:\n\n10 lbs/adult ÷ 2 = 5 lbs/child.\n\nWith 5 children attending the picnic, the total consumption by children will be:\n\n5 children × 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.\n\nNow, we add the quantities needed for adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad:\n\nTotal potato salad = Total for adults + Total for children\nTotal potato salad = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.\n\nTherefore, Ted needs to bring a total of 225 lbs of potato salad to ensure there is enough for everyone at the picnic.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can recalculate each group:\n- Adults: 20 × 10 = 200 lbs\n- Children: 5 × 5 = 25 lbs\nAdding these gives us 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs, confirming our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 225 lbs of potato salad needed. \\n#### 225 lbs",
