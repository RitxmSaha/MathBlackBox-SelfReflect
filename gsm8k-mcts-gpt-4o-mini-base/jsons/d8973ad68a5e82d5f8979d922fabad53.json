        "[reasoning process] \n1. First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties and each blue tie costs $40, we can calculate the number of blue ties by dividing the total cost by the cost per blue tie: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue ties} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \\frac{200}{40} = 5.\n   \\]\n   \n2.

Finally, we will add the total costs of blue and red ties together to find the total amount John spent on all ties:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spent on ties} = \\text{Total cost of blue ties} + \\text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800.\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\n- Number of blue ties: \\(5\\)\n- Number of red ties: \\(10\\)\n- Cost of blue tie: \\($40\\)\n- Cost of red tie calculated: \\($60\\)\n- Total spent on blue ties: \\($200\\)\n- Total spent on red ties: \\(10 \\times 60 = 600\\)\n- Total spent overall: \\(200 + 600 = 800\\)\n\nThe calculations confirm that the total amount spent by John on ties is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 800 \n#### 800",
