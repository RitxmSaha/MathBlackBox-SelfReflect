        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many cookies Cody eats. We know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. Given that Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's consumption as follows:\n\nCody's cookies = 3 * Amir's cookies = 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cookies both of them eat together. To do this, we simply add the number of cookies each person eats:\n\nTotal cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies = 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.\n\n[Verification] Let's check the calculations. Amir eats 5 cookies, and since Cody eats three times that amount:\n\nCody's cookies = 3 * 5 = 15. \n\nAdding both:\n\n5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.\n\nThe calculations hold true, so our reasoning is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20",
