How many quilt blocks does he have in total?",
    "ground_truth": "Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.\nHe goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.\nGene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.\n#### 44",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many years Gene has been vacationing. He is currently 34 years old and started vacationing at 23. Thus, the number of years he has been vacationing is:\n\n34 - 23 = 11 years\n\nNext, we know that Gene goes on four vacations each year. Therefore, to find the total number of vacation shirts (or quilt blocks), we can multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year:\n\n11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations\n\nThus, he has a total of 44 quilt blocks.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations. Gene is currently 34 years old and started vacationing at age 23. The difference is indeed:\n\n34 - 23 = 11 years.  \nAnd for the number of vacations:\n\n4 vacations/year * 11 years = 44 quilt blocks.\n\nBoth calculations confirm that the total number is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 44  \n#### 44",
