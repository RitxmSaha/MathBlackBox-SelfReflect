        "[reasoning process] Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half as long, which is 1 hour (since half of 2 hours is 1 hour). Therefore, in one session of watching TV and reading, he spends a total of 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours. He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, Jim spends 3 times 3 hours, which equals 9 hours. Over the course of 4 weeks, he will have done this activity 4 times, so we multiply the weekly total by 4: 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours. \n\n[Verification] To verify, let’s break it down: \n- In one week, he has 3 sessions, each lasting 3 hours, leading to 3 sessions * 3 hours/session = 9 hours/week.\n- For 4 weeks, 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours total. \n\nThis confirms our calculation is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
