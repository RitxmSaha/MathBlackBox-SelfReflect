        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon. This can be calculated by multiplying the price per gallon by the number of gallons purchased:\n\nTotal cost before cashback = Price per gallon × Number of gallons = $3.00 × 10 = $30.00.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much cashback the individual will receive for buying 10 gallons. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so we multiply this by the number of gallons:\n\nCashback = Cashback per gallon × Number of gallons = $0.20 × 10 = $2.00.\n\nTo find the final cost after cashback, we subtract the cashback from the total cost:\n\nFinal cost = Total cost before cashback - Cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check our calculations: \n\n1. The total cost of gas is indeed $30.00 for 10 gallons at $3.00 each. \n2. The cashback totals $2.00 for purchasing 10 gallons at $0.20 each.\n3. Subtracting the cashback from the total gives $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00. \n\nAll calculations check out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $28.00 \\n#### $28.00",
