        "[reasoning process] To determine how many hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on one dog each day and then extend that to the total for all dogs. Each dog takes 0.5 hours per day for walking and care. Since John has 10 dogs, we multiply the time per dog by the number of dogs:\n\nTime for one dog per day = 0.5 hours\nTime for 10 dogs per day = 0.5 hours/dog * 10 dogs = 5 hours\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours he spends in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:\n\nTime for 10 dogs in a week = 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations:\n- For 1 dog: 0.5 hours\n- For 10 dogs: 0.5 hours * 10 = 5 hours\n- For a week: 5 hours/day * 7 days = 35 hours/week\n\nThe calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35 hours \\n#### 35",
