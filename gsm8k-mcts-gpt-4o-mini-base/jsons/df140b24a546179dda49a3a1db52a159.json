        "[reasoning process] \nLet's analyze the contents of the basket systematically. \n\n1. **Total Oranges**: The basket contains 25 oranges in total.\n2. **Bad Oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.\n3. **Unripe Oranges**: 20% of the oranges are unripe. We calculate 20% of 25:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 25 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, there are 5 unripe oranges.\n4. **Sour Oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.\n5. **Counting the Unripe, Bad, and Sour Oranges**: Now we sum the identified types of oranges:\n   - Bad oranges: 1\n   - Unripe oranges: 5\n   - Sour oranges: 2\n\n   Adding these gives:\n   \\[\n   1 + 5 + 2 = 8\n   \\]\n   This means there are 8 oranges that are either bad, unripe, or sour.\n6. **Calculating Good Oranges**: To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the total number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:\n   \\[\n   25 - 8 = 17\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify step by step:\n- Total oranges = 25\n- Bad = 1, Unripe = 5, Sour = 2.
