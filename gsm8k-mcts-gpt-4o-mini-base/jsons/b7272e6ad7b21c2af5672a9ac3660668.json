        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine Raymond's age. Since Samantha is currently 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:  \n- Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years  \n- Raymond's age = 31 + 6 = 37 years old.\n\nNext, we calculate how many years ago Raymond had his son. It is given that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago that was, we subtract Raymond's age when he had his son from his current age:  \n- Raymond's current age - Age at which he had his son = 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.\n\nNow, we confirm the calculations to verify. If Raymond is currently 37 years old and he had his son at the age of 23, that indeed indicates his son was born 14 years ago.\n\n[Verification]  \nRaymond's age = 37 years.  \nRaymond had a son at 23 years old.  \nCurrent age - Age when son was born = 37 - 23 = 14 years ago, which confirms that the previous calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14 \\n#### 14",
