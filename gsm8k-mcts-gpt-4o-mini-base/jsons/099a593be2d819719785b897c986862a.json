        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start by letting Darrell's age be represented by 7x and Allen's age by 11x, based on the given ratio of their ages (7:11). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n7x + 11x = 162. \n\nCombining the terms gives us:\n\n18x = 162.\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 18:\n\nx = 162 / 18  \nx = 9.\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can calculate their current ages. \n\nDarrell's age is:\n\n7x = 7 * 9 = 63 years old.\n\nAllen's age is:\n\n11x = 11 * 9 = 99 years old.\n\nNext, we need to calculate Allen's age 10 years from now. We'll do this by adding 10 to his current age:\n\n99 + 10 = 109 years old.\n\n[Verification]  \nNow, let's verify our values. The total of their ages should be 162: \n\n63 + 99 = 162, which is correct. Additionally, their ages in the original ratio should be 7:11:\n\n63 / 9 = 7 and 99 / 9 = 11, which confirms the ratio.
