        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining how many jewels Raymond has. According to the problem, Raymond has 40 jewels. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. The problem states that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. We can calculate half of Raymond's jewels:\n\nHalf of Raymond's jewels = 40 jewels / 2 = 20 jewels.\n\nNow, adding 5 jewels to that amount to find Aaron's total:\n\nAaron's jewels = 20 jewels + 5 jewels = 25 jewels.\n\nNext, we will calculate how many jewels Siobhan has.
