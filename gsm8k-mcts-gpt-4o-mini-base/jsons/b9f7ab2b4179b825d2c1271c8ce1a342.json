        "[reasoning process] To find the original price of the book before the discount, we start by understanding what the 25% discount means. If Kyle bought the book for $19.50, this price represents 75% of the original price because 100% (the original price) minus 25% (the discount) equals 75%. We can express this relationship with an equation: \n\nLet \\( P \\) represent the original price.
