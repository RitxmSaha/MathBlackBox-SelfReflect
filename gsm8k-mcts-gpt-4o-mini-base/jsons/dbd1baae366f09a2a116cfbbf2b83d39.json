    "ground_truth": "Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000\nCombining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000\nDividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000\n#### 8000",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \\( H \\). According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, which we can denote as \\( 10H \\). Together, the total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000.
