        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem, we need to determine the distances Henry traveled between his first and second stops during his bike trip. We know the following:\n\n1. Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles.\n2. His first stop occurred after 20 miles.\n3. His second stop was 15 miles before completing the trip.\n\nTo find out how far he traveled to his second stop, we first calculate the distance to the second stop:\n\n- The trip is 60 miles long and he stopped 15 miles from the end. Therefore, the distance to his second stop is:\n  \\[\n  60 \\text{ miles} - 15 \\text{ miles} = 45 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we determine the distance traveled between his first and second stops:\n\n- He stopped first at 20 miles and second at 45 miles. Thus, the distance he traveled between these two stops is:\n  \\[\n  45 \\text{ miles} - 20 \\text{ miles} = 25 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\n[Verification] The calculations confirm that Henry traveled 20 miles to his first stop and then 25 miles to his second stop, bringing him to 45 miles. From there, he would travel 15 miles to complete the trip, totaling the 60-mile journey. Each calculation checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 miles \\n#### 25 miles",
