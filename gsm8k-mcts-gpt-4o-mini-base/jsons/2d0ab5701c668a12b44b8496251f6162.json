    "ground_truth": "If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving\nWe also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams\nIf I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams\n#### 48",

        "[reasoning process] The first step is to determine how many calories are remaining in the daily calorie target after consuming 1800 calories. Since the daily target is 2000 calories, I subtract the consumed calories from this target: \n\n2000 - 1800 = 200 calories remaining.\n\nNext, we know that each serving of chips has 250 calories, and the bag contains 5 servings. Therefore, the total calorie content of the entire bag of chips is:\n\n250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories per 300g bag.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many grams of chips I can consume without exceeding the 200 calories remaining. The chips provide 250 calories for each serving, which can be calculated per gram as follows:\n\nSince the whole bag (300g) is 1250 calories, the calorie content per gram is:\n\n1250 calories / 300g = 4.167 calories per gram.\n\nNow, I can find out how many grams I can eat with the remaining 200 calories:\n\n200 calories divided by the calories per gram equals:\n\n200 calories / 4.167 calories per gram ≈ 48 grams.\n\n[Verification] To ensure my calculations are accurate, I will verify the calorie count for 48 grams:\n\nCalories in 48 grams = 48 grams * 4.167 calories/gram ≈ 200 calories.\n\nThis confirms that 48 grams of chips will utilize the remaining 200 calories, allowing me to stay within my target.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 grams \\n#### 48 grams",
