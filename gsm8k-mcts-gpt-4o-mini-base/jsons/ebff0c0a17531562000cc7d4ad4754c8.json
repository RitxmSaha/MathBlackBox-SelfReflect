        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many teams there are in total. There are four schools, and each school has a girls' team and a boys' team. This means each school contributes 2 teams (1 girls' and 1 boys'), so:\n\nNumber of teams = 4 schools × 2 teams per school = 8 teams.\n\nNext, each team has 5 players, so the total number of players contributed by all the teams is:\n\nTotal number of players = 8 teams × 5 players per team = 40 players.\n\nMoreover, each team has a coach, and since there are 8 teams, the total number of coaches is:\n\nTotal number of coaches = 8 teams × 1 coach per team = 8 coaches.\n\nNow, we can compute the total number of people sent by all the schools, which includes both players and coaches:\n\nTotal number of people = Total number of players + Total number of coaches = 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.\n\n[Verification] We counted the total number of teams and calculated the number of players and coaches correctly.
