        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we are given the number of sheep in Seattle, which is 20. Next, we need to determine how many sheep Charleston has. We know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, we can calculate Charleston's sheep as follows:  \n\nCharleston's sheep = 4 * Seattle's sheep  \nCharleston's sheep = 4 * 20  \nCharleston's sheep = 80  \n\nNext, we find the number of sheep in Toulouse.
