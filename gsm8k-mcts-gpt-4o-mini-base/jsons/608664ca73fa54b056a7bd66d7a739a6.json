        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining how much John runs each day. We know that he runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. \n\n1. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. \n2. On the second day and third day, he runs for half of 3 hours, which is 1.5 hours each.\n\nNow we can calculate the total running time over the week:\n- First day: 3 hours\n- Second day: 1.5 hours\n- Third day: 1.5 hours\n\nTotal running time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.\n\nNext, we know John runs a total of 60 miles a week. To find his speed, we'll use the formula for speed:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nWe have the total distance (60 miles) and total time (6 hours). Thus:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can double-check the calculations:\n- Total distance: 60 miles\n- Total time: 6 hours\n- Calculating speed: \\( 60 \\div 6 = 10 \\) miles per hour confirms our previous calculation.\n\nThe result is consistent when evaluating the distance run and the hours spent running.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
