    "ground_truth": "Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.\nAfter Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.\nEach 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.\nThus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.\n#### 3",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's break down how much TV Frankie watched each night:\n\n- **Monday**: 1 hour (1 episode)\n- **Tuesday**: 1 hour (1 episode)\n- **Wednesday**: Let's say he watched \\( x \\) episodes of a 30-minute show. Since each episode is 0.5 hours, this is \\( 0.5x \\) hours.\n- **Thursday**: 1 hour (1 episode) + 0.5 hours (1 episode) = 1.5 hours\n- **Friday**: 2 hours (2 episodes)\n\nNow we can sum up the TV time for the week:\n\nTotal TV time = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday\n= 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\nTotal TV time = 5.5 + 0.5x\n\nWe know from the problem statement that the total TV time equals 7 hours. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\n5.5 + 0.5x = 7\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first isolate \\( 0.5x \\):\n\n0.5x = 7 - 5.5\n0.5x = 1.5\n\nNow, divide by 0.5:\n\nx = 1.5 / 0.5\nx = 3\n\nThis means Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify by calculating the total TV time again using \\( x = 3 \\):\n\n- **Monday**: 1 hour\n- **Tuesday**: 1 hour\n- **Wednesday**: 3 episodes of 0.5 hours each = 1.5 hours\n- **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours\n- **Friday**: 2 hours\n\nTotal TV time = 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours, which matches the problem's statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
