        "[reasoning process] To determine how many total meters James runs in a week, we first need to calculate the total distance he runs in one session of sprints. James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint covers a distance of 60 meters. Therefore, the total distance for one session can be calculated as:\n\nTotal distance in one session = Number of sprints × Distance per sprint\nTotal distance in one session = 3 sprints × 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters\n\nNext, we need to find out how many sessions James runs in a week. He runs these sprints 3 times a week. Thus, we can calculate the total distance he runs in a week:\n\nTotal distance in a week = Total distance in one session × Number of sessions per week\nTotal distance in a week = 180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week = 540 meters\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by breaking down the process again. First, the distance per session was determined to be 180 meters, then we multiplied this by the number of sessions per week (3). So:\n\n- First session: 3 sprints × 60 meters = 180 meters\n- Total for the week: 180 meters × 3 = 540 meters\n\nThe calculations remain consistent throughout the reasoning. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 540 meters. \\n#### 540",
