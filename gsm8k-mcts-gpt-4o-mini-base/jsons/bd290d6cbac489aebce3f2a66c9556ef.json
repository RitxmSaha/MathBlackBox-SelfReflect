        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber that Sasha originally bought. \n\nFor the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:\n- She bought ten boards at $10 each.\n- Total cost for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards x $10/board = $100.\n\nFor the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:\n- She bought five boards at $16 each.\n- Total cost for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards x $16/board = $80.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of all the boards:\n- Total cost = Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards \n- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.\n\nNow, let's determine the selling prices after the 50% increase:\n- The selling price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards = original cost + 50% of original cost = $10 + (0.50 x $10) = $10 + $5 = $15.\n- The selling price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards = original cost + 50% of original cost = $16 + (0.50 x $16) = $16 + $8 = $24.\n\nNow we calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:\nFor the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:\n- Revenue from selling all ten boards = 10 boards x $15/board = $150.\n\nFor the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:\n- Revenue from selling all five boards = 5 boards x $24/board = $120.\n\nNow, we can find the total revenue from selling all the boards:\n- Total revenue = Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards\n- Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270.\n\nFinally, we calculate the profit:\n- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost\n- Profit = $270 - $180 = $90.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, I will check each step:\n1.

Total revenue calculated as $150 (from 2x4 boards) + $120 (from 4x4 boards) = $270.\n4.
