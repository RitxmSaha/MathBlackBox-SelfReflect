        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year for her puppy. The first 180 days, she will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. After that, for the remaining days in the year, she will feed it 2 cups per day.\n\n1. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:\n   - Daily food amount: 1 cup\n   - Total for 180 days: 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups\n\n2. Next, determine the remaining days in the year after the first 180 days. A year has 365 days:\n   - Remaining days: 365 days - 180 days = 185 days\n\n3. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for those 185 days:\n   - Daily food amount: 2 cups\n   - Total for 185 days: 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups\n\n4. Now, add the total cups needed for both periods:\n   - Total dog food needed = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups\n\n5. Now we need to determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia must buy. Each bag contains 110 cups:\n   - Total bags needed = Total cups / Cups per bag = 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags\n\n[Verification] We computed the total amount of food needed and divided by the amount in each bag of dog food. The calculations are sound:\n- First 180 days: 180 cups\n- Last 185 days: 370 cups\n- Total: 550 cups\n- Divided by 110 cups per bag = 5 bags\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
