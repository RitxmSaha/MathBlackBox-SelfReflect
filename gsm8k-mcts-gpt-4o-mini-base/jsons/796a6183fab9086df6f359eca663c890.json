        "[reasoning process] To determine how much shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we start by calculating the total duration of time the candle burns. From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of 4 hours. \n\nNext, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. To find out how much the candle will melt in 4 hours, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total melting} = \\text{Number of hours} \\times \\text{Melting rate per hour} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\times 2 \\text{ cm/hour} = 8 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, by burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations. The time interval from 1 PM to 5 PM is indeed 4 hours. The melting rate is confirmed as 2 cm every hour. So, calculating the total reduction:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ hours} \\times 2 \\text{ cm/hour} = 8 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that our initial calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
