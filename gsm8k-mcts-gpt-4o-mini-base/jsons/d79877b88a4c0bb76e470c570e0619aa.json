        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes John bought in total. He has 3 children, and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child. Therefore, we calculate the total number of pairs of shoes: \n3 children × 2 pairs per child = 6 pairs of shoes. \n\nNext, we find out the total cost of these shoes. Each pair costs $60. We multiply the total number of pairs by the cost per pair: \n6 pairs × $60 per pair = $360.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, let's break it down again. John buys 2 pairs for each of his 3 children:\n- For the first child: 2 pairs = $60 × 2 = $120.\n- For the second child: 2 pairs = $60 × 2 = $120.\n- For the third child: 2 pairs = $60 × 2 = $120. \n\nNow, adding these amounts together:\n$120 + $120 + $120 = $360.\n\nBoth methods yield the same total, confirming the calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 360 \n#### 360",
