    "ground_truth": "Let L be the number of losses.\nThe number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.\nThe team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.\nSo, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14\nSo L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.\nTherefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process] Let the number of games the team lost be represented by L. According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can represent the number of winning games (W) as W = L + 8. \n\nSince the team played a total of 22 games, the relationship between wins, losses, and total games can be expressed as:\nW + L = 22.\n\nSubstituting the expression for W into the total games equation gives us:\n(L + 8) + L = 22.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n2L + 8 = 22.\n\nNext, we subtract 8 from both sides:\n2L = 22 - 8,\n2L = 14.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\nL = 14 / 2,\nL = 7.\n\nNow that we have the number of losses, we can find the number of wins using W = L + 8:\nW = 7 + 8,\nW = 15.\n\nSo the team won 15 games.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our solution. If the team won 15 games and lost 7 games, then the total number of games played is:\n15 (wins) + 7 (losses) = 22 games. This matches the information given in the problem statement. Additionally, 15 is indeed 8 more than 7, which confirms our solution.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
