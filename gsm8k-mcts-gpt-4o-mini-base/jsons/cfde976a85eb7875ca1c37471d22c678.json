        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of roses. Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each bush has 25 roses. We can calculate the total number of roses by multiplying the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush:\n\nTotal Rose = Number of Bushes × Roses per Bush  \nTotal Rose = 3 × 25 = 75 roses\n\nNext, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we will multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns each rose has:\n\nTotal Thorns = Total Roses × Thorns per Rose  \nTotal Thorns = 75 roses × 8 thorns/rose = 600 thorns\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations:\n1. Number of roses: \\( 3 \\times 25 = 75 \\)\n2. Number of thorns: \\( 75 \\times 8 = 600 \\)\n\nBoth calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 600  \n#### 600",
