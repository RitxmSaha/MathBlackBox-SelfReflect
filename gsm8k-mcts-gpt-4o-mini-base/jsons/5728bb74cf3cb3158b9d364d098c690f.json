    "ground_truth": "Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.\nHer hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.\nSo, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.\nHer regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.\nThus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.\n#### 460",
