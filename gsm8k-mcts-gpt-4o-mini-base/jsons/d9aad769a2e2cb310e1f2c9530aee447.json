Some of the cars drive through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. 5 cars from the line take an exit so they don't have to drive through the traffic jam.

    "ground_truth": "The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.\nMost of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] \nLet's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \\( x \\).

After the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through in the second 15 minutes. \n\nIn total, \\( x + 20 \\) cars drove through the traffic jam. Additionally, we know that 5 cars exited the line, meaning they did not drive through the traffic jam. \n\nThis gives us the equation:\n\\[\n30 - 5 = 25\n\\]\nThis means that there were 25 cars that either drove through the traffic jam or remained in the line. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\nx + 20 = 25\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we can rearrange the equation:\n\\[\nx = 25 - 20\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 5\n\\]\nTherefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. \n\n[Verification] \nLet’s verify if our solution is correct. If 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes and 20 drove through in the next 15 minutes, that adds up to:\n\\[\n5 + 20 = 25\n\\]\nSince 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that were originally on the motorway was indeed 30. Thus, the calculation is consistent, and our original assumption is validated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
