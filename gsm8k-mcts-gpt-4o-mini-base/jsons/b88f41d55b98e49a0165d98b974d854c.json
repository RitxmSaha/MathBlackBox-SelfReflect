    "query": "Julia’s boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?",
    "ground_truth": "It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.\nThus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.\nIn those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.\nThus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.\n#### 16",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine Julia's rowing speed. We know that she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find her speed in feet per second, we can calculate:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.\n\nNext, we are told that it takes her 64 seconds to reach the shore. We can confirm the total distance she will row to reach the shore by multiplying her speed by the time it takes:\n\nDistance to shore = Speed × Time = 1.25 feet/second × 64 seconds = 80 feet.\n\nNow, we need to determine how much water the boat takes on during her journey back to shore. We know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. We can find out how many groups of 10 feet are in 80 feet:\n\nNumber of 10-foot segments = 80 feet / 10 feet per segment = 8 segments.\n\nSince the boat takes on 2 liters of water for each 10-foot segment, the total amount of water taken on by the time she reaches the shore can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal water taken on = 8 segments × 2 liters/segment = 16 liters.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify each step:\n- Julia's rowing speed calculated as 1.25 feet/second is consistent with her rowing for 20 feet in 16 seconds. \n- The distance to shore calculated as 80 feet is consistent with rowing for 64 seconds at that speed.\n- The number of segments (8) calculated from 80 feet is accurate as 80 feet is indeed 8 groups of 10 feet.\n- Finally, multiplying 8 segments by 2 liters confirms the boat has taken on 16 liters of water.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 liters \\n#### 16",
