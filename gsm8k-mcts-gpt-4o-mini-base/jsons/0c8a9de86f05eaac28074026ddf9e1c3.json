        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we start by identifying the amount of each color of fiber used. The problem states that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. For the white fiber, it states that it takes half the amount of blue fiber needed, which is 2 bolts. Therefore, we calculate half of 2 bolts, which gives us 1 bolt of white fiber. Now, we can calculate the total amount of fiber by adding the bolts of blue and white fiber together. \n\nTotal fiber = bolts of blue + bolts of white = 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step: \n- We have 2 bolts of blue fiber: confirmed.\n- Half of the blue fiber is 1 bolt of white fiber: confirmed (half of 2 is indeed 1).\n- Adding the blue and white fibers: 2 + 1 = 3 bolts total: confirmed.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
