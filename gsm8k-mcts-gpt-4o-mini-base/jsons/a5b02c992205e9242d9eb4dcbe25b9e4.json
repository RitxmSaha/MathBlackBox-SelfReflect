        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we first need to calculate the number of fruits from the clusters. There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 fruits. So, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of fruits per cluster:\n\n6 clusters × 20 fruits/cluster = 120 fruits in clusters.\n\nNext, we add the number of individual fruits scattered across the bush, which is 67. Now we can combine these two amounts to find the total number of raspberries:\n\nTotal raspberries = Fruits in clusters + Individual fruits\nTotal raspberries = 120 + 67 = 187.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations:\n1. Calculate the number of fruits from clusters:\n   6 × 20 = 120.\n2. Add the individual fruits:\n   120 + 67 = 187.\n\nBoth calculations are correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 187 \\n#### 187",
