        "[reasoning process] \nTo calculate how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we start with the details given: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many yogurts he will consume over 30 days:\n- Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.\n- Over 30 days, he will eat:  \n  \\( 2 \\text{ yogurts/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 60 \\text{ yogurts} \\).\n\nNext, we know that the yogurts are on sale at a price of $5.00 for 4 yogurts.
