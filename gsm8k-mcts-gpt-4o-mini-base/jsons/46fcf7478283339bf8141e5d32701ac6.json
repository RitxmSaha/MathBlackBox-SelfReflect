        "[reasoning process] \n\nLet's denote the following variables:\n- Let \\( J \\) be the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold.\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.\n- Let \\( D \\) be the number of ducks (or birds) in Jamal's photograph.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. \\( J = 1800 \\) (the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold).\n2.
