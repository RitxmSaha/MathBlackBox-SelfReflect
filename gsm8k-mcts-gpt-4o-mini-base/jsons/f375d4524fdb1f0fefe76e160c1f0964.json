        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many servings of ice cream Cynthia consumes in 60 days. Since she eats one serving every night, this means she will eat 60 servings in total after 60 days. \n\nNext, we know that each carton of ice cream contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cartons} = \\frac{\\text{Total servings}}{\\text{Servings per carton}} = \\frac{60}{15} = 4\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Cynthia buys 4 cartons, we can calculate the total cost. The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Number of cartons} \\times \\text{Cost per carton} = 4 \\times 4.00 = 16.00\n\\]\n\nNow, let's verify the calculations. \n\n1. Cynthia consumes 1 serving per night for 60 nights, which totals 60 servings.\n2. From the 60 servings, the number of cartons required is indeed 4 (as 60 divided by 15 equals 4).\n3. Finally, multiplying the 4 cartons by the $4.00 cost per carton gives us a total of $16.00.\n\n[Verification]\nEach calculation checks out correctly, verifying that the computed quantities are consistent. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $16.00 \\n#### 16.00",
