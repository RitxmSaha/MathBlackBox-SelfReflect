    "query": "Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?",
    "ground_truth": "Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.\nHe had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.\nTherefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \\( x \\). According to the problem, this year he intended to bake twice as many cookies, which would be \\( 2x \\). However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he planned, so the actual number of cookies he baked is:\n\n\\[\n2x + 15\n\\]\n\nAfter baking, he accidentally dropped 5 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies he has left is:\n\n\\[\n(2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10\n\\]\n\nWe also know that, after dropping the cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n2x + 10 = 110\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x = 110 - 10\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 50\n\\]\n\nThis means that Henry baked 50 cookies last year. \n\n[Verification] To verify, let's calculate the number of cookies he intended to bake this year.
