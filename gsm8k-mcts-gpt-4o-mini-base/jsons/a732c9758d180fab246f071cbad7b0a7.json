        "[reasoning process] First, we will calculate the total cost of the brooch's material and construction. Janet paid $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler's services. We add these two amounts together:\n\nTotal cost of material and construction = $500 + $800 = $1300.\n\nNext, we will calculate the insurance cost. Janet pays 10% of the total cost to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we perform the following calculation:\n\nInsurance cost = 10% of $1300 = 0.10 × $1300 = $130.\n\nNow we will find the total amount Janet paid in total, which includes the cost of the material, the jeweler's fee, and the insurance. We add the insurance cost to the previous total:\n\nTotal amount paid = Total cost of material and construction + Insurance cost = $1300 + $130 = $1430.\n\n[Verification] I first confirmed the total cost for the materials and construction as $1300. Then, I calculated the insurance cost as 10% of that total, which is $130. Finally, I added these amounts together to verify that the total cost Janet paid comes out to $1430. All calculations appear to be accurate and consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $1430 \\n#### 1430",
