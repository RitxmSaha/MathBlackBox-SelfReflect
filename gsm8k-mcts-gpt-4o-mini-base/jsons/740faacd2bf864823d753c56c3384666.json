        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of pages Solo has to read. He has the following pages to read from each subject:\n\n- Science: 4 pages\n- Social Studies: 20 pages\n- History: 7 pages\n- Geography: 8 pages\n\nNow, we sum these amounts:\n\nTotal pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages\n\nNext, we know that Solo read 15 pages on Monday. We need to calculate how many pages he has left to read after this:\n\nPages left = Total pages - Pages read on Monday\nPages left = 39 - 15 = 24 pages\n\nNow, Solo has 4 more days to complete the remaining reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day over the next 4 days, we divide the pages left by the number of days remaining:\n\nAverage pages per day = Pages left / Days remaining\nAverage pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can multiply the average number of pages Solo needs to read each day by the number of days to see if we return to the pages left:\n\n6 pages/day * 4 days = 24 pages\n\nSince this matches the number of pages left, our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
