        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate how many boys and girls are in the class of 200 Grade 5 students. Given that 2/5 of them are boys, we can find the number of boys by calculating:\n\nNumber of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80 boys.\n\nNext, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\nNumber of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120 girls.\n\nNow, according to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find out how many girls are in the girl scout, we calculate:\n\nNumber of girls in girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls.\n\nTo find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in girl scout from the total number of girls:\n\nNumber of girls not in girl scout = Total girls - Girls in girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40 girls.\n\n[Verification] We have initially calculated the number of boys to be 80 and then determined that there are 120 girls. We also found that 2/3 of these girls, which is 80, are in the girl scout, leaving us with 40 girls who are not in the girl scout.
