    "ground_truth": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.\n#### 18",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many eggs Janet has left after she eats and uses some each day. She starts with 16 eggs daily.\n\nJanet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins, so the total number of eggs consumed is:  \n3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs.\n\nNext, we find out how many eggs Janet has left to sell:  \n16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs consumed) = 9 eggs remaining.\n\nNow, Janet sells these remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. To find out her total earnings from selling the eggs, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg:  \n9 (remaining eggs) × $2 (per egg) = $18.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's check our calculations:\n- Total eggs laid = 16\n- Eggs eaten + used = 3 + 4 = 7\n- Eggs remaining to sell = 16 - 7 = 9\n- Earnings from selling remaining eggs = 9 × 2 = $18.\n\nEverything checks out correctly. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18  \n#### 18",
