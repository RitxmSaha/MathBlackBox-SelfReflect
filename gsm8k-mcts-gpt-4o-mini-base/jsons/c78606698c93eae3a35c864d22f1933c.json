    "ground_truth": "30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5\nHe needs to remove 7.5 more pounds because 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5\nHe needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate how much weight Uriah will remove if he takes out 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so the total weight removed by taking out 30 comic books is calculated as follows:\n\nWeight removed from comic books = 30 comic books × (1/4 pound/comic book) = 30 × 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much more weight Uriah needs to remove to reach the total of 15 pounds. Since he has already taken out 7.5 pounds from the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:\n\nWeight still needed to remove = 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNow, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to eliminate the remaining 7.5 pounds, we calculate:\n\nNumber of toys to remove = Weight still needed to remove / Weight per toy\nNumber of toys to remove = 7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.\n\n[Verification] To confirm our solution, we can check if removing 15 toys will indeed result in the needed weight being removed. If Uriah removes 15 toys, the weight removed from the toys will be:\n\nWeight removed from toys = 15 toys × (1/2 pound/toy) = 15 × 0.5 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNow, adding the weight removed from the comic books, we have:\n\nTotal weight removed = Weight removed from comic books + Weight removed from toys\nTotal weight removed = 7.5 pounds + 7.5 pounds = 15 pounds.\n\nThis verifies that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
