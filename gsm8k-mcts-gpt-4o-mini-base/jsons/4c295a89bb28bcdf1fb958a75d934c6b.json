She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?",
    "ground_truth": "To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon\nTo find how far Olivia can go on a single tank, multiply 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = <<25*12=300>>300 miles\n#### 300",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to find her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon. We know she has driven 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank. \n\n1. Calculate her car's miles per gallon (MPG) using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{MPG} = \\frac{\\text{miles driven}}{\\text{gallons used}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ gallons}} = 25 \\text{ miles per gallon}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we can use this MPG figure to find out how far she can drive on a full tank. Since her car's tank holds 12 gallons, we multiply the MPG by the total capacity of the tank:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Distance} = \\text{MPG} \\times \\text{Tank Capacity} = 25 \\text{ miles per gallon} \\times 12 \\text{ gallons} = 300 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify the MPG calculation: Sophia drove 100 miles using 4 gallons, yielding 25 MPG, which checks out. Then we also confirmed the total distance calculation:\n- 25 miles per gallon times 12 gallons equals 300 miles, which makes sense for her vehicle's capacity and fuel efficiency.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 miles \\n#### 300 miles",
