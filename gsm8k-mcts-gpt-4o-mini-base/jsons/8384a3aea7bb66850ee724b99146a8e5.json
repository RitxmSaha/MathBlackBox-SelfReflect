        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the cost of the boots as \\( B \\). According to the problem, the combined cost of the two pairs of heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. The first pair of heels costs $33 and the second pair costs twice as much, which means the second pair costs \\( 2 \\times 33 = 66 \\). Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of heels is:\n\n\\[\n33 + 66 = 99\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, we have the equation:\n\n\\[\nB = 99 + 5\n\\]\n\nThis is because the combined cost of the heels is $5 less than the boots. Thus, we can rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n\\[\nB = 104\n\\]\n\nNow we have found the cost of the boots. \n\n[Verification] To verify, we will check the relation between the costs. The boots cost $104. The total cost of the heels is $99, which is indeed $5 less than the cost of the boots:\n\n\\[\n104 - 99 = 5\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 104 \n#### 104",
