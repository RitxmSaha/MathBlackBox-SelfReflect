        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of units in the apartment building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can find the total number of units using the formula:\n\nTotal units = Number of floors × Units per floor  \nTotal units = 15 × 8 = 120 units\n\nNext, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. Thus, we can calculate the number of occupied units:\n\nOccupied units = Total units × 3/4  \nOccupied units = 120 × 3/4 = 90 units\n\nNow, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:\n\nUnoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units  \nUnoccupied units = 120 - 90 = 30 units\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can check our calculations again: \n- Total units is correctly calculated as 15 × 8 = 120.\n- The number of occupied units is indeed 120 × (3/4) = 90.\n- Subtracting gives us 120 - 90 = 30 unoccupied units, confirming our previous results.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30  \n#### 30",
