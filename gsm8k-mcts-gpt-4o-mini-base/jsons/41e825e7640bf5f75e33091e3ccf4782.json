        "[reasoning process] To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total amount earned from both the brownies and the cheesecakes separately, and then add those amounts together. \n\n1. First, calculate the total earnings from the brownies:\n   - The price of each brownie slice is $3.\n   - Tommy sells 43 brownie slices.\n   - Total from brownies = Price per slice × Number of slices = $3 × 43.\n\n2. Next, calculate the total earnings from the cheesecakes:\n   - The price of each cheesecake slice is $4.\n   - Tommy sells 23 cheesecake slices.\n   - Total from cheesecakes = Price per slice × Number of slices = $4 × 23.\n\n3. Finally, add the total earnings from the brownies and cheesecakes together to get Tommy's total fundraising amount.\n\nNow, let's compute these values:\n- Total from brownies: $3 × 43 = $129.\n- Total from cheesecakes: $4 × 23 = $92.\n\nAdding these together:\nTotal amount raised = Total from brownies + Total from cheesecakes = $129 + $92 = $221.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check:\n- Brownies: 43 slices × $3/slice = $129.\n- Cheesecakes: 23 slices × $4/slice = $92.\n- Total: $129 + $92 = $221.\n\nEverything checks out correctly, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $221 \\n#### $221",
