        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to find out how many points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. We know that in the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. The problem states that in the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.\n\nTo calculate 25% of 4 points, we perform the following calculation:\n25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes. Since he scores 25% more points than 4 points:\nPoints in the second 20 minutes = 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.\n\nNow, to find the total points scored by Mike throughout the 40 minutes, we add the points from both time periods:\nTotal points = Points in the first 20 minutes + Points in the second 20 minutes = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify our calculations:\n- In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.\n- In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than 4 points, which is 1 additional point, leading to a total of 5 points in that period.\n- Summing these gives us a total of 9 points throughout the entire 40 minutes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9  \n#### 9",
