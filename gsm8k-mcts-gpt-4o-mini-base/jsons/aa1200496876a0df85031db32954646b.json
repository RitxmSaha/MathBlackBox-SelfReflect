        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's calculate the distance John drove during his initial trip away from home. He drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The formula to find distance is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nSo, the distance John drove away from home is:\n\nDistance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nNow, he turns around to head back home. He wants to get home in 4 hours, but he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, which means he doesn't cover any distance during that time.\n\nAfter being stuck in traffic for 2 hours, he has 2 hours left to drive. In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drives at a speed of 30 mph:\n\nDistance in half-hour = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.\n\nNow, he has 1.5 hours left (2 hours - 0.5 hours) to drive back home. During this time, he drives at a speed of 80 mph. \n\nDistance in the remaining 1.5 hours = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow, let’s calculate the total distance he covered towards home after the traffic:\n\nTotal distance towards home = Distance in traffic (0 miles) + Distance at 30 mph (15 miles) + Distance at 80 mph (120 miles) = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.\n\nNow we need to determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours. He was initially 180 miles away from home. After driving back for 135 miles, we find the distance from home:\n\nDistance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered towards home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations:\n1. Initial distance away from home: 180 miles.\n2. Distance covered towards home: 15 miles (at 30 mph for 0.5 hours) + 120 miles (at 80 mph for 1.5 hours) = 135 miles.\n3. Distance from home after all driving efforts: 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.\n\nAll calculations confirm that he is indeed 45 miles away from home.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45 miles \\n#### 45 miles",
