        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of the hours Harry slept, we can calculate that by multiplying Harry's sleep hours by 2/3. Harry slept 9 hours, so we calculate \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 = \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow we know that James slept 6 hours. Next, we find how many more hours Harry slept than James by subtracting the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:\n\\[\n9 - 6 = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, I’ll check the sleep time of both individuals: Harry sleeps 9 hours and James, who slept 6 hours (which is indeed 2/3 of Harry's sleep time). The difference is:\n\\[\n9 - 6 = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nThis confirms that Harry slept 3 more hours than James.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
