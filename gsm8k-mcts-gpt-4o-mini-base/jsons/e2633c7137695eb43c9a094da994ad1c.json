    "ground_truth": "Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.\nAt 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.\nAt 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.\n#### 12",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to establish how much canned tomatoes she started with before they were cooked down into sauce.\n\nFreda ended up with 32 ounces of sauce after cooking down the tomatoes. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume during cooking, we can deduce that she used 64 ounces of canned tomatoes to produce that 32 ounces of sauce (because 64 ounces reduced by half equals 32 ounces).\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes she used. Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes. To find out how many cans are in 64 ounces, we perform the calculation: \n\n64 ounces ÷ 16 ounces per can = 4 cans of tomatoes.\n\nNow, we know that each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, to find out the total number of tomatoes used in 4 cans, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:\n\n4 cans × 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.\n\nThus, Freda used 12 tomatoes in her last batch of sauce.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check our calculations: \n- The volume of tomatoes used was 64 ounces.\n- The number of cans used was calculated as 4 (64 ounces / 16 ounces per can).\n- The total number of tomatoes was calculated as 12 (4 cans × 3 tomatoes per can).\n\nSince all calculations are consistent, the answer is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12  \n#### 12",
