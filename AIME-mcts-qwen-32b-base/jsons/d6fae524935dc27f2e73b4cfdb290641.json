Consider the central angle subtended by each disk at the center of the larger circle \\( C \\). Since there are 12 disks, each central angle is \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{12} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\).\n2. The centers of two adjacent disks, along with the center of the larger circle, form an isosceles triangle with two sides of length 1 (the radius of the larger circle) and a central angle of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\). The distance between the centers of two adjacent disks is \\( 2r \\) (the sum of their radii).\n3.
