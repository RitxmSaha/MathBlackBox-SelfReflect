Iterate through all possible values of \\(abc\\) (i.e., from 1 to 998).\n2. Divide each fraction by its greatest common divisor (GCD) with 999 to get the fraction in its lowest terms.\n3. Collect these reduced numerators and find the count of unique numerators.\n\nThe prime factorization of 999 is \\(999 = 3^3 \\times 37\\). Thus, a fraction in its lowest terms will have a numerator that is not divisible by 3 or 37.\n\nLet's write a Python program to perform these steps.\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Set to store unique numerators\nunique_numerators = set()\n\n# Iterate through all possible values of abc (1 to 998)\nfor abc in range(1, 999):\n    # Calculate the greatest common divisor\n    gcd = math.gcd(abc, 999)\n    # Reduce the fraction to its lowest terms\n    reduced_numerator = abc // gcd\n    # Add the unique numerator to the set\n    unique_numerators.add(reduced_numerator)\n\n# The number of unique numerators\nnum_unique_numerators = len(unique_numerators)\nprint(num_unique_numerators)\n```\n```output\n660\n```\n[Verification] The code iterates through all possible numerators from 1 to 998, reduces each fraction to its lowest terms with the denominator 999, and collects the unique numerators. The final count of unique numerators is 660.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{660}\\) \\n#### 660"
