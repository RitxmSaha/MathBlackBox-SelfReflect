Let's review the solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas that could be improved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The function \\( f \\) satisfies \\( f(2 + x) = f(2 - x) \\) and \\( f(7 + x) = f(7 - x) \\).\n   - This means \\( f \\) is symmetric about \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n   - Given \\( f(0) = 0 \\), we need to find the least number of roots in the interval \\(-1000 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\).\n\n2. **Finding Roots Based on Symmetry:**\n   - If \\( f(0) = 0 \\), using the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), we get \\( f(4) = 0 \\).\n   - Using the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), we get \\( f(14) = 0 \\).\n   - If \\( f(4) = 0 \\), using the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), we already have \\( f(0) = 0 \\).\n   - Using the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), we get \\( f(10) = 0 \\).\n   - If \\( f(14) = 0 \\), using the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), we get \\( f(-10) = 0 \\).\n   - Using the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), we already have \\( f(14) = 0 \\).\n\n   So far, we have the roots \\( \\{0, 4, 10, 14, -10\\} \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Period:**\n   - We find that the roots repeat in a period of 14. Specifically, the set of roots within one period is \\( \\{0, 4, 10, 14, -10\\} \\).\n   - The period is \\( \\text{lcm}(4, 14) = 28 \\). However, the correct periodicity based on the roots is actually 14, not 28.\n\n4. **Counting the Roots in the Interval:**\n   - The interval \\(-1000 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\) can be divided into \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2000}{14} \\right\\rfloor = 142 \\) complete periods plus some additional roots at the boundaries.\n   - In each period, there are 5 roots.\n   - So, the number of roots from complete periods is \\( 142 \\times 5 = 710 \\).\n\n5. **Checking Additional Roots at the Boundaries:**\n   - We need to check the additional roots within the remaining interval \\(-1000 \\leq x < -1000 + 14 \\times 142 = -1000 + 1988 = 988\\) and \\(988 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\).\n   - For the interval \\(-1000 \\leq x < -1000 + 14\\), the only root is \\( -1000 \\) within the period, which is not included as it is exactly on the boundary.\n   - For the interval \\(988 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\), the roots are \\( 990, 994, 998, 1000, 988 \\). So, there are 4 roots in this interval.\n\n6. **Total Roots:**\n   - Total roots = \\( 710 + 4 = 714 \\).\n\n### Flaws and Corrections\n\n1. **Periodicity Error:**\n   - The correct periodicity is 14, not 28. Thus, the number of complete periods is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2000}{14} \\right\\rfloor = 142 \\).\n\n2. **Counting Roots:**\n   - Each period has 5 roots, so the number of roots from complete periods is \\( 142 \\times 5 = 710 \\).\n   - Additional roots at the boundaries need to be counted carefully.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - The number of additional roots at the boundaries should be corrected to ensure no roots are missed or counted twice.\n\n### Final Correct Calculation\n\nLet's correct the calculation and verify it using Python.\n\n```python\n# Define the interval and period\ninterval_start = -1000\ninterval_end = 1000\nperiod = 14\n\n# Calculate the number of complete periods within the interval\nnum_complete_periods = (interval_end - interval_start) // period\n\n# Calculate the number of roots within one period\nroots_per_period = 5\n\n# Calculate total roots from complete periods\ntotal_roots_complete_periods = num_complete_periods * roots_per_period\n\n# Check additional roots at the boundaries (start and end of interval)\n# Roots within start and end intervals might not be complete periods\nadditional_roots_start = sum(interval_start <= root < interval_start + period for root in [0, 4, 10, 14, -10])\nadditional_roots_end = sum(interval_end - period <= root <= interval_end for root in [0, 4, 10, 14, -10])\n\n# Total roots are sum of roots from complete periods and additional roots at boundaries\ntotal_roots = total_roots_complete_periods + additional_roots_start + additional_roots_end\n\nprint(total_roots)\n```",

            "[Analyst] The solution starts well by identifying the symmetries of the function and using them to find the roots. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Period Calculation**: The period is correctly identified as 28, but the reasoning for the roots within the interval should be more rigorous. The roots repeat every 28 units, but the problem doesn't specify that the roots within one period are exactly 0, 4, 10, 14, and -10. There might be other roots within one period due to the nature of the function, and this should be clarified.\n\n2. **Boundary Handling**: The handling of the boundaries is incorrect. The number of roots at the start and end of the interval should be counted correctly based on the periodicity. Specifically, the additional roots at the boundaries are not correctly calculated. The additional roots should be determined by checking how many of the roots 0, 4, 10, 14, -10 fall within the interval start and end points, considering the period.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Overlapping Roots**: The calculation should exclude overlapping roots at the boundaries. For example, if the interval starts at -1000, the first root after the start point will be -982 (since -1000 + 14 = -986 and -994 is the next root), and the last root before the end point will be 994 (since 1000 - 6 = 994).\n\n4. **Code Implementation**: The code correctly calculates the number of complete periods and the additional roots, but the logic for counting the additional roots at the boundaries is flawed.

For example, the derivation of roots from \\( f(4) = 0 \\) and \\( f(14) = 0 \\) can be further expanded to ensure clarity.\n\n2. **Periodicity Calculation**: While the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 14 being 28 is correct, the explanation of why the period is 28 could be clearer. It should be explicitly stated that the periodicity is due to the combined symmetries about \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n\n3. **Boundary Handling**: The handling of the boundary conditions, especially the additional roots at the start and end of the interval, could be improved for clarity and robustness. The code correctly counts the additional roots, but a more explicit mathematical explanation would add rigor.\n\n4. **Generalization and Formalization**: The solution could be more generalized and formalized, especially in terms of mathematical notation. For example, explicitly stating the set of roots derived from the symmetries and the periodicity.\n\n5. **Python Code Readability**: The Python code is correct, but it could be more readable and well-commented to make it easier to follow the logic.

However, stating that the roots are \\(0, 4, 10, 14,\\) and \\(-10\\) without explicitly tying these back to the original symmetries and the least common multiple (LCM) could be confusing.\n   \n2. **Periodicity**:\n   - The period of the function is identified as 28, which is correct. This is derived from the least common multiple of the distances between the axes of symmetry (4 and 14). Stating this more clearly and justifying it step-by-step would strengthen the proof.\n   \n3. **Counting Roots in the Interval**:\n   - The calculation of the number of complete periods within the interval is accurate but the addition of roots at the boundaries could be clearer. For instance, checking if the interval boundaries themselves are roots is a bit unclear in the code.\n   \n4. **Boundary Conditions**:\n   - The boundary conditions are not handled explicitly in the code, which could lead to misinterpretation.

However, the additional roots count at the boundaries hasn't been carefully verified term-by-term, which could lead to counting errors.\n\n2. **Boundary Handling:** The code logic for counting additional roots at the boundaries (`additional_roots_start` and `additional_roots_end`) isn't entirely robust. It assumes that if a root falls within the first or last period, it should be counted.

Let's review the solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas that could be improved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The function \\( f \\) satisfies \\( f(2 + x) = f(2 - x) \\) and \\( f(7 + x) = f(7 - x) \\).\n   - This means \\( f \\) is symmetric about \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n   - Given \\( f(0) = 0 \\), we need to find the least number of roots in the interval \\(-1000 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\).\n\n2. **Finding Roots Based on Symmetry:**\n   - If \\( f(0) = 0 \\), using the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), we get \\( f(4) = 0 \\).\n   - Using the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), we get \\( f(14) = 0 \\).\n   - If \\( f(4) = 0 \\), using the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), we already have \\( f(0) = 0 \\).\n   - Using the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), we get \\( f(10) = 0 \\).\n   - If \\( f(14) = 0 \\), using the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), we get \\( f(-10) = 0 \\).\n   - Using the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), we already have \\( f(14) = 0 \\).\n\n   So far, we have the roots \\( \\{0, 4, 10, 14, -10\\} \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Period:**\n   - We find that the roots repeat in a period of 14. Specifically, the set of roots within one period is \\( \\{0, 4, 10, 14, -10\\} \\).\n   - The period is \\( \\text{lcm}(4, 14) = 28 \\). However, the correct periodicity based on the roots is actually 14, not 28.\n\n4. **Counting the Roots in the Interval:**\n   - The interval \\(-1000 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\) can be divided into \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2000}{14} \\right\\rfloor = 142 \\) complete periods plus some additional roots at the boundaries.\n   - In each period, there are 5 roots.\n   - So, the number of roots from complete periods is \\( 142 \\times 5 = 710 \\).\n\n5. **Checking Additional Roots at the Boundaries:**\n   - We need to check the additional roots within the remaining interval \\(-1000 \\leq x < -1000 + 14 \\times 142 = -1000 + 1988 = 988\\) and \\(988 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\).\n   - For the interval \\(-1000 \\leq x < -1000 + 14\\), the only root is \\( -1000 \\) within the period, which is not included as it is exactly on the boundary.\n   - For the interval \\(988 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\), the roots are \\( 990, 994, 998, 1000, 988 \\). So, there are 4 roots in this interval.\n\n6. **Total Roots:**\n   - Total roots = \\( 710 + 4 = 714 \\).\n\n### Flaws and Corrections\n\n1. **Periodicity Error:**\n   - The correct periodicity is 14, not 28. Thus, the number of complete periods is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2000}{14} \\right\\rfloor = 142 \\).\n\n2. **Counting Roots:**\n   - Each period has 5 roots, so the number of roots from complete periods is \\( 142 \\times 5 = 710 \\).\n   - Additional roots at the boundaries need to be counted carefully.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - The number of additional roots at the boundaries should be corrected to ensure no roots are missed or counted twice.\n\n### Final Correct Calculation\n\nLet's correct the calculation and verify it using Python.\n\n```python\n# Define the interval and period\ninterval_start = -1000\ninterval_end = 1000\nperiod = 14\n\n# Calculate the number of complete periods within the interval\nnum_complete_periods = (interval_end - interval_start) // period\n\n# Calculate the number of roots within one period\nroots_per_period = 5\n\n# Calculate total roots from complete periods\ntotal_roots_complete_periods = num_complete_periods * roots_per_period\n\n# Check additional roots at the boundaries (start and end of interval)\n# Roots within start and end intervals might not be complete periods\nadditional_roots_start = sum(interval_start <= root < interval_start + period for root in [0, 4, 10, 14, -10])\nadditional_roots_end = sum(interval_end - period <= root <= interval_end for root in [0, 4, 10, 14, -10])\n\n# Total roots are sum of roots from complete periods and additional roots at boundaries\ntotal_roots = total_roots_complete_periods + additional_roots_start + additional_roots_end\n\nprint(total_roots)\n```",

            "Certainly! Let's review the solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas that could be improved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The function \\( f \\) satisfies \\( f(2 + x) = f(2 - x) \\) and \\( f(7 + x) = f(7 - x) \\).\n   - This means \\( f \\) is symmetric about \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n   - Given \\( f(0) = 0 \\), we need to find the least number of roots in the interval \\(-1000 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\).\n\n2. **Finding Roots Based on Symmetry:**\n   - If \\( f(0) = 0 \\), using the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), we get \\( f(4) = 0 \\).\n   - Using the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), we get \\( f(14) = 0 \\).\n   - If \\( f(4) = 0 \\), using the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), we already have \\( f(0) = 0 \\).\n   - Using the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), we get \\( f(10) = 0 \\).\n   - If \\( f(14) = 0 \\), using the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), we get \\( f(-10) = 0 \\).\n   - Using the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), we already have \\( f(14) = 0 \\).\n\n   So far, we have the roots \\( \\{0, 4, 10, 14, -10\\} \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Period:**\n   - We find that the roots repeat in a period of 14. Specifically, the set of roots within one period is \\( \\{0, 4, 10, 14, -10\\} \\).\n   - The period is \\( \\text{lcm}(4, 14) = 28 \\). However, the correct periodicity based on the roots is actually 14, not 28.\n\n4. **Counting the Roots in the Interval:**\n   - The interval \\(-1000 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\) can be divided into \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2000}{14} \\right\\rfloor = 142 \\) complete periods plus some additional roots at the boundaries.\n   - In each period, there are 5 roots.\n   - So, the number of roots from complete periods is \\( 142 \\times 5 = 710 \\).\n\n5. **Checking Additional Roots at the Boundaries:**\n   - We need to check the additional roots within the remaining interval \\(-1000 \\leq x < -1000 + 14 \\times 142 = -1000 + 1988 = 988\\) and \\(988 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\).\n   - For the interval \\(-1000 \\leq x < -1000 + 14\\), the only root is \\( -1000 \\) within the period, which is not included as it is exactly on the boundary.\n   - For the interval \\(988 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\), the roots are \\( 990, 994, 998, 1000, 988 \\). So, there are 4 roots in this interval.\n\n6. **Total Roots:**\n   - Total roots = \\( 710 + 4 = 714 \\).\n\n### Flaws and Corrections\n\n1. **Periodicity Error:**\n   - The correct periodicity is 14, not 28. Thus, the number of complete periods is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2000}{14} \\right\\rfloor = 142 \\).\n\n2. **Counting Roots:**\n   - Each period has 5 roots, so the number of roots from complete periods is \\( 142 \\times 5 = 710 \\).\n   - Additional roots at the boundaries need to be counted carefully.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - The number of additional roots at the boundaries should be corrected to ensure no roots are missed or counted twice.\n\n### Final Correct Calculation\n\nLet's correct the calculation and verify it using Python.\n\n```python\n# Define the interval and period\ninterval_start = -1000\ninterval_end = 1000\nperiod = 14\n\n# Calculate the number of complete periods within the interval\nnum_complete_periods = (interval_end - interval_start) // period\n\n# Calculate the number of roots within one period\nroots_per_period = 5\n\n# Calculate total roots from complete periods\ntotal_roots_complete_periods = num_complete_periods * roots_per_period\n\n# Check additional roots at the boundaries (start and end of interval)\n# Roots within start and end intervals might not be complete periods\nadditional_roots_start = sum(interval_start <= root < interval_start + period for root in [0, 4, 10, 14, -10])\nadditional_roots_end = sum(interval_end - period <= root <= interval_end for root in [0, 4, 10, 14, -10])\n\n# Total roots are sum of roots from complete periods and additional roots at boundaries\ntotal_roots = total_roots_complete_periods + additional_roots_start + additional_roots_end\n\nprint(total_roots)\n```",

The distances between the axes of symmetry are \\( 5 \\) (i.e., \\( 7 - 2 = 5 \\)). The LCM of 4 (from the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\)) and 14 (from the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\)) is \\( 28 \\).

            "### Reflection and Feedback\n\n#### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1. **Symmetry Understanding**:\n   - Given \\( f(2 + x) = f(2 - x) \\), the function is symmetric about \\( x = 2 \\).\n   - Given \\( f(7 + x) = f(7 - x) \\), the function is symmetric about \\( x = 7 \\).\n   - Together, these symmetries imply that the function is periodic with a period that is the least common multiple (LCM) of twice the distances between the axes of symmetry. The distances between the axes of symmetry are \\( 5 \\) (i.e., \\( 7 - 2 = 5 \\)). The LCM of 4 (from the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\)) and 14 (from the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\)) is \\( 28 \\). However, we need to look at the symmetry more carefully to find the actual period.\n   \n2. **Root Identification**:\n   - Given \\( f(0) = 0 \\), because of the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), \\( f(4) = 0 \\).\n   - Because of the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), \\( f(14) = 0 \\).\n   - Because of the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\) again, \\( f(-4) = 0 \\).\n   - Because of the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\) again, \\( f(0) = 0 \\) (already counted).\n   - Because of the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), \\( f(10) = 0 \\).\n   - Because of the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), \\( f(4) = 0 \\) (already counted).\n   - Because of the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), \\( f(14) = 0 \\) (already counted).\n   - Because of the symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), \\( f(-10) = 0 \\).\n   - Because of the symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), \\( f(0) = 0 \\) (already counted).\n   - And so on...\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - The roots form a pattern with a period of 14. This is because \\( f(2 + x) = f(2 - x) \\) and \\( f(7 + x) = f(7 - x) \\) imply that the function repeats every 14 units (not 28, as initially thought).\n\n4. **Counting Roots**:\n   - We need to count how many multiples of the roots \\( 0, 4, 10, 14, -10, -4 \\) fit into the interval \\([-1000, 1000]\\).\n\n### Detailed Calculation:\n\n- **Number of complete periods**:\n  - The interval length is \\( 2000 \\).\n  - Number of complete periods within the interval \\( \\frac{2000}{14} = 142 \\) complete periods with a remainder.\n\n- **Roots per Period**:\n  - Each period contains 6 unique roots within one period.\n\n- **Roots in Complete Periods**:\n  - \\( 142 \\text{ periods} \\times 6 \\text{ roots/period} = 852 \\text{ roots} \\).\n\n- **Additional Roots in Incomplete Periods**:\n  - Start interval: Roots within \\([-1000, -1000 + 14*142]\\).\n  - End interval: Roots within \\([14*142, 1000]\\).\n  - Check additional roots from \\( x = 0, 4, 10, 14, -4, -10 \\) within these intervals.\n\n### Detailed Verification\n\nLet's verify this with more detailed code:\n```python\n# Define the interval and period\r\ninterval_start = -1000\r\ninterval_end = 1000\r\nperiod = 14\r\n\r\n# Roots within one period: 0, 4, 10, 14, -4, -10\r\nroots_in_period = [0, 4, 10, 14, -4, -10]\r\n\r\n# Calculate the number of complete periods within the interval\r\nnum_complete_periods = (interval_end - interval_start) // period\r\n\r\n# Calculate total roots from complete periods\r\ntotal_roots_complete_periods = num_complete_periods * len(roots_in_period)\r\n\r\n# Determine additional roots in the incomplete periods at the boundaries\r\n# Check additional roots in the start interval: [-1000, -1000 + 14*142]\r\nstart_period_start = interval_start\r\nstart_period_end = interval_start + num_complete_periods * period\r\n\r\n# Roots in the start interval\r\nadditional_roots_start = [root for root in roots_in_period if start_period_start <= root <= start_period_end]\r\n\r\n# Check additional roots in the end interval: [interval_end - remainder, interval_end]\r\nremainder = (interval_end - interval_start) % period\r\nend_period_start = interval_end - remainder + 1\r\nend_period_end = interval_end\r\n\r\n# Roots in the end interval\r\nadditional_roots_end = [root for root in roots_in_period if end_period_start <= root <= end_period_end]\r\n\r\n# Combining additional roots from the start and end intervals\r\nadditional_roots = additional_roots_start + additional_roots_end\r\n\r\n# Ensure unique roots by using a set\r\nall_roots = set(additional_roots)\r\n\r\n# Roots from complete periods\r\nfor k in range(num_complete_periods):\r\n    for root in roots_in_period:\r\n        root_shifted = root + k * period\r\n        all_roots.add(root_shifted)\r\n\r\n# Total number of unique roots in the interval\r\ntotal_unique_roots = len(all_roots)\r\nprint(total_unique_roots)\n```",

However, the given solution considers a period of 14, which might be correct under specific conditions, but it needs to be derived correctly.\n\n3. **Roots Identification**:\n   - Given \\( f(0) = 0 \\), due to symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), \\( f(4) = 0 \\).\n   - Due to symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\), \\( f(14) = 0 \\), \\( f(10) = 0 \\), \\( f(-4) = 0 \\), and \\( f(-10) = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - Within one period of 14, the roots are \\( 0, 4, 10, 14, -4, -10 \\).\n\n5. **Counting Roots in the Interval**:\n   - The interval size is \\( 2000 \\) (from \\(-1000\\) to \\(1000\\)).\n   - Number of complete periods within the interval: \\( \\frac{2000}{14} = 142 \\) complete periods with a remainder of \\( 12 \\).\n\n6. **Roots in Complete Periods**:\n   - Each period contains 6 unique roots.\n   - Total roots from complete periods: \\( 142 \\times 6 = 852 \\).\n\n7. **Additional Roots in Incomplete Periods**:\n   - Roots within the start interval \\([-1000, -1000 + 14 \\times 142]\\):\n     - Check \\( 0, 4, 10, 14, -4, -10 \\) within \\([-1000, 1000 - 8]\\).\n   - Roots within the end interval \\([1000 - 12, 1000]\\):\n     - Check \\( 0, 4, 10, 14, -4, -10 \\) within \\([988, 1000]\\).\n\n8. **Unique Roots**:\n   - Ensure that we count only unique roots in the entire interval.\n\n### Flaws and Criticism\n\n1. **Periodicity Derivation**:\n   - The periodicity should be derived from the symmetry conditions. The correct period should be 10, not 14. This is because the LCM of the distances between the symmetries (5 units apart) should be considered, not the direct distance between the points of symmetry.\n\n2. **Roots in Each Period**:\n   - Within one period of 10, the roots are \\( 0, 4, 6, 10, -4, -6 \\). This would give us 6 unique roots per period, which matches the initial reasoning.\n\n3. **Counting Roots in the Interval**:\n   - Number of complete periods within the interval: \\( \\frac{2000}{10} = 200 \\) complete periods.\n   - Total roots from complete periods: \\( 200 \\times 6 = 1200 \\).\n\n4. **Additional Roots in Incomplete Periods**:\n   - Roots within the start interval \\([-1000, -1000 + 10 \\times 200]\\):\n     - Check \\( 0, 4, 6, 10, -4, -6 \\) within \\([-1000, 1000]\\).\n   - Roots within the end interval \\([1000 - 0, 1000]\\):\n     - Check \\( 0, 4, 6, 10, -4, -6 \\) within \\([1000, 1000]\\).\n\n5. **Unique Roots**:\n   - Ensure that we count only unique roots in the entire interval.\n\n### Corrected Solution\n\nGiven the corrected periodicity and root pattern, the least number of unique roots in the interval \\([-1000, 1000]\\) should be \\( 1200 \\) from complete periods, plus any additional unique roots in the incomplete periods.\n\nLet's verify this with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Define the interval and period\r\ninterval_start = -1000\r\ninterval_end = 1000\r\nperiod = 10\r\n\r\n# Roots within one period: 0, 4, 6, 10, -4, -6\r\nroots_in_period = [0, 4, 6, 10, -4, -6]\r\n\r\n# Calculate the number of complete periods within the interval\r\nnum_complete_periods = (interval_end - interval_start) // period\r\n\r\n# Calculate total roots from complete periods\r\ntotal_roots_complete_periods = num_complete_periods * len(roots_in_period)\r\n\r\n# Determine additional roots in the incomplete periods at the boundaries\r\n# Check additional roots in the start interval: [-1000, -1000 + 10*200]\r\nstart_period_start = interval_start\r\nstart_period_end = interval_start + num_complete_periods * period\r\n\r\n# Roots in the start interval\r\nadditional_roots_start = [root for root in roots_in_period if start_period_start <= root <= start_period_end]\r\n\r\n# Check additional roots in the end interval: [interval_end - remainder, interval_end]\r\nremainder = (interval_end - interval_start) % period\r\nend_period_start = interval_end - remainder + 1\r\nend_period_end = interval_end\r\n\r\n# Roots in the end interval\r\nadditional_roots_end = [root for root in roots_in_period if end_period_start <= root <= end_period_end]\r\n\r\n# Combining additional roots from the start and end intervals\r\nadditional_roots = additional_roots_start + additional_roots_end\r\n\r\n# Ensure unique roots by using a set\r\nall_roots = set(additional_roots)\r\n\r\n# Roots from complete periods\r\nfor k in range(num_complete_periods):\r\n    for root in roots_in_period:\r\n        root_shifted = root + k * period\r\n        all_roots.add(root_shifted)\r\n\r\n# Total number of unique roots in the interval\r\ntotal_unique_roots = len(all_roots)\r\nprint(total_unique_roots)\n```",

        "[Reasoning Process]\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the symmetries of the function \\( f \\) and how they affect the roots of the equation \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\n1. **Symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\):**\n   - The equation \\( f(2 + x) = f(2 - x) \\) tells us that \\( f \\) is symmetric about \\( x = 2 \\).\n   - The equation \\( f(7 + x) = f(7 - x) \\) tells us that \\( f \\) is symmetric about \\( x = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Given Root:**\n   - We know that \\( f(0) = 0 \\).

The correct period should be 10, not 14. This is because the LCM of the distances between the symmetries (5 units apart) should be considered, not the direct distance between the points of symmetry.\n\n2. **Roots in Each Period**:\n   - Within one period of 10, the roots are \\( 0, 4, 6, 10, -4, -6 \\).
