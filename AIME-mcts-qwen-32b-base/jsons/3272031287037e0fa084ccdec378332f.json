Let's denote the sum of the first 6 terms as \\( S_6 \\):\n\n\\[\nS_6 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = x + y + (y - x) + (-x) + (-y) + (x - y) = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the first 1492 terms. Since \\( 1492 \\div 6 = 248 \\) with a remainder of 4, the sum of the first 1492 terms is equivalent to the sum of 248 complete cycles of 6 terms plus the next 4 terms:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{1492} a_n = 248 \\cdot S_6 + (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) = 0 + (x + y + (y - x) + (-x)) = -x + 2y.\n\\]\n\nWe are given that this sum is 1985:\n\n\\[\n-x + 2y = 1985.\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the sum of the first 1985 terms. Since \\( 1985 \\div 6 = 330 \\) with a remainder of 5, the sum of the first 1985 terms is equivalent to the sum of 330 complete cycles of 6 terms plus the next 5 terms:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{1985} a_n = 330 \\cdot S_6 + (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5) = 0 + (x + y + (y - x) + (-x) + (-y)) = -x + y.\n\\]\n\nWe are given that this sum is 1492:\n\n\\[\n-x + y = 1492.\n\\]\n\nWe now have a system of linear equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n-x + 2y = 1985, \\\\\n-x + y = 1492.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n\\[\n(-x + 2y) - (-x + y) = 1985 - 1492 \\implies y = 493.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( y = 493 \\) into the second equation to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n-x + 493 = 1492 \\implies -x = 999 \\implies x = -999.\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the sum of the first 2001 terms. Since \\( 2001 \\div 6 = 333 \\) with a remainder of 3, the sum of the first 2001 terms is equivalent to the sum of 333 complete cycles of 6 terms plus the next 3 terms:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{2001} a_n = 333 \\cdot S_6 + (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) = 0 + (-999 + 493 + (493 + 999)) = -999 + 493 + 1492 = 986.\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can use Python to verify the calculations and ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\r\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\nx, y = symbols('x y')\r\n\r\n# Define the equations based on the sums given in the problem\r\neq1 = Eq(-x + 2*y, 1985)\r\neq2 = Eq(-x + y, 1492)\r\n\r\n# Solve the system of equations\r\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\r\nx_value = solution[x]\r\ny_value = solution[y]\r\n\r\n# Calculate the sum of the first 2001 terms\r\n# The sequence repeats every 6 terms, and the sum of 6 terms is 0\r\n# So we only need to calculate the sum of the first 3 terms of the sequence\r\nterm1 = x_value\r\nterm2 = y_value\r\nterm3 = y_value - x_value\r\n\r\n# Sum of the first 2001 terms\r\nsum_2001 = (2001 // 6) * 0 + (term1 + term2 + term3)\r\nprint((solution, sum_2001))\n```\n```output\n({x: -999, y: 493}, 986)\n```\nThe solution to the system of equations confirms that \\( x = -999 \\) and \\( y = 493 \\). Using these values, we calculated the sum of the first 2001 terms of the sequence, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{986}\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the first 2001 terms of the sequence is 986."
