            "[Analyst] The solution provided correctly identifies the largest two-digit prime factor of \\(\\binom{200}{100}\\) as 61. However, there are a few minor points to consider:\n\n1. **Explanation Clarity:** The reasoning provided is mathematically sound, but it could be expanded to provide more context around the formula for calculating the exponent of a prime in a factorial. This could help ensure a deeper understanding, especially for those who may not be familiar with the formula.\n\n2. **Prime List Generation:** The code leverages the `primerange` function from the `sympy` library to generate all two-digit prime numbers. This is efficient, but a manual implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes or another prime generation method could demonstrate a deeper understanding of number theory.\n\n3. **Edge Cases:** The code correctly handles the calculation of the exponent for each prime and checks if it is a factor of \\(\\binom{200}{100}\\). However, mentioning edge cases like the smallest two-digit primes (11, 13, etc.) could provide more comprehensive coverage.\n\n4. **Variable Naming:** The variables `exp_200` and `exp_100` are reasonable, but more descriptive names like `exp_200_factorial` and `exp_100_factorial` could improve clarity.\n\n5. **Output Justification:** While the output is correct, a brief justification of why 61 is the largest two-digit prime factor could be helpful for clarity.\n\n[Score]-20"

        "[Reasoning process] To solve this problem, we need to find the largest two-digit prime factor of \\(\\binom{200}{100} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}\\). We will proceed by identifying the prime factors of \\(200!\\) and \\(100!\\), and then calculate the result.\n\nThe formula to find the exponent of a prime \\(p\\) in \\(n!\\) (denoted as \\(v_p(n!)\\)) is given by:\n\\[\nv_p(n!) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n\\]\nSo, the exponent of \\(p\\) in \\(\\binom{200}{100}\\) is:\n\\[\nv_p\\left( \\binom{200}{100} \\right) = v_p(200!) - 2 \\cdot v_p(100!)\n\\]\nA prime factor \\(p\\) will be a factor of \\(\\binom{200}{100}\\) if and only if \\(v_p\\left( \\binom{200}{100} \\right) > 0\\). \n\nAfter finding all prime factors of \\(\\binom{200}{100}\\), we will determine the largest two-digit prime among them.\n\nLet's write Python code to perform these calculations.\n```python\nfrom math import floor, isqrt\r\nfrom sympy import primerange\r\n\r\n# Function to find the exponent of prime p in n!\r\ndef exponent_in_factorial(n, p):\r\n    exp = 0\r\n    power = p\r\n    while power <= n:\r\n        exp += n // power\r\n        power *= p\r\n    return exp\r\n\r\n# Finding the largest 2-digit prime factor of C(200, 100)\r\nmax_prime_factor = 0\r\n\r\n# Generate all 2-digit prime numbers\r\nprimes = list(primerange(10, 100))\r\n\r\n# Iterate over all 2-digit prime numbers\r\nfor p in primes:\r\n    exp_200 = exponent_in_factorial(200, p)\r\n    exp_100 = exponent_in_factorial(100, p)\r\n    if exp_200 - 2 * exp_100 > 0:\r\n        max_prime_factor = p\r\n\r\nprint(max_prime_factor)\n```\n```output\n61\n```\n[Verification] We have verified that the largest two-digit prime factor of \\(\\binom{200}{100} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}\\) is 61.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{61}\\) \\n#### 61"
