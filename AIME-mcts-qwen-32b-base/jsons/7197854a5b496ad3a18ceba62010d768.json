It would be more rigorous to explain why 30 bits are sufficient and why a different number of bits might not work.\n\n3. **Verification Step**: The verification step using a programmatic approach is a good practice to ensure correctness, but the code itself could be improved by adding comments or a more detailed explanation of the code logic.\n\n4. **Formatting and Clarity**: The response is clear, but the formatting could be improved by using more sections or subheadings to break down the explanation. This would make it easier to follow the solution's logic.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: No explicit discussion is provided on edge cases, such as the smallest or largest terms in the sequence.
