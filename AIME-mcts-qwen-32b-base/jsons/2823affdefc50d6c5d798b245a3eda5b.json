        "[Reasoning process] \nThe given sequence is \\( a_n = 100 + n^2 \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\).\n\nWe need to find \\( d_n \\), the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a_n \\) and \\( a_{n+1} \\).\n\nThe problem can be approached by expressing \\( d_n \\) mathematically and then finding the maximum value \\( d_n \\) can take as \\( n \\) ranges through the positive integers. Specifically,\n\n\\[ d_n = \\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1}) = \\gcd(100 + n^2, 100 + (n+1)^2) \\]\n\nFirst, let's simplify \\( a_{n+1} \\):\n\n\\[ a_{n+1} = 100 + (n+1)^2 = 100 + n^2 + 2n + 1 \\]\n\nSo, the problem becomes:\n\n\\[ d_n = \\gcd(100 + n^2, 100 + n^2 + 2n + 1) \\]\n\nSince \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, b-a)\\):\n\n\\[ d_n = \\gcd(100 + n^2, (100 + n^2 + 2n + 1) - (100 + n^2)) \\]\n\n\\[ d_n = \\gcd(100 + n^2, 2n + 1) \\]\n\nWe now need to determine the GCD of \\( 100 + n^2 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) for various values of \\( n \\).\n\nTo find the maximum value of \\( d_n \\), we'll calculate \\( d_n \\) for a range of \\( n \\) values and identify the maximum GCD.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute this.\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_max_gcd(limit):\n    max_gcd = 0\n    for n in range(1, limit + 1):\n        a_n = 100 + n**2\n        a_n1 = 100 + (n + 1)**2\n        d_n = math.gcd(a_n, a_n1)\n        if d_n > max_gcd:\n            max_gcd = d_n\n    return max_gcd\n\n# Set a reasonable upper limit to iterate and find the maximum GCD\nmax_gcd = calculate_max_gcd(1000)\nprint(max_gcd)\n```\n```output\n401\n```\nThe maximum value of \\( d_n \\) as \\( n \\) ranges through the positive integers is found to be \\( 401 \\). Hence, the final answer is:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\( \\boxed{401} \\)\n#### 401"
