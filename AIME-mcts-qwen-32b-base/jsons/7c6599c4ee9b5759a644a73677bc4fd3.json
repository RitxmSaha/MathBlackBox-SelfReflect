        "[Reasoning process] To find the smallest positive multiple of 15 such that every digit of the number is either 8 or 0, we must consider the factors of 15, which are 3 and 5. For a number to be a multiple of 5, it must end with 0. For a number to be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Therefore, the number must include enough 8s to make the digits sum to a multiple of 3 and end with one or more 0s.\n\nSince the number can only consist of 8s and 0s, the smallest sum of digits that is a multiple of 3 and includes at least one 0 would be obtained by the smallest sequence of 8s that sum to a multiple of 3. The smallest sum of 8s that is divisible by 3 is 24 (since 8 * 3 = 24). Thus, the number we are looking for is the smallest number that has three 8s (24) and ends with a 0. This number is 8880. Therefore, $n = 8880$.\n\nTo compute $\\frac{n}{15}$, we simply divide 8880 by 15. \n\n[Verification] We can verify this by calculating the value of 8880 divided by 15 and ensuring it results in an integer.

            "[Analyst] The reasoning and solution provided are mostly correct, but there are some points that could be improved:\n\n1. **Detailed Verification of Divisibility**: While the code verifies that 8880 is divisible by 15, it would be more thorough to explicitly check that the sum of the digits of 8880 is divisible by 3 (8 + 8 + 8 + 0 = 24, which is divisible by 3) and that it ends with a 0 to confirm divisibility by 5. This step is crucial in explaining why 8880 is the smallest number that meets the criteria.\n2. **Formal Proof of Smallest Number**: The reasoning that 8880 is the smallest such number is somewhat intuitive but lacks a formal proof. It would be better to show that no smaller number composed of only 8s and 0s can meet the criteria. For example, showing that numbers with fewer than three 8s cannot be divisible by 3.\n3. **Code Explanation**: The code is correct but lacks comments or explanations for each step, which would make it clearer for someone unfamiliar with the solution.\n4. **Final Answer Formatting**: The final answer is correctly boxed, but the presentation of the score and analysis should be more structured and explicit in pointing out the imperfections.\n\nDespite these points, the core solution is correct and the reasoning is mostly sound.\n\n[Score]-10\n\nThe score is -10 because the solution is correct but could be improved in terms of thoroughness and clarity."
