        "[Reasoning Process]...\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many rational numbers between 0 and 1, when expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, result in the product of the numerator and denominator being \\(20!\\).\n\nGiven a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) in lowest terms, the product \\(a \\cdot b = 20!\\). Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be factors of \\(20!\\), and they must not have any common factors other than 1 (since the fraction is in lowest terms). \n\nThe number of such fractions is essentially the number of ways to split the prime factorization of \\(20!\\) between the numerator \\(a\\) and the denominator \\(b\\), under the constraint that \\(a < b\\) (since the fraction is between 0 and 1).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\):\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe total number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 78624\\]\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where \\(a = b = \\sqrt{20!}\\), because there is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 = 20!\\) (since \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square).

        "[Reasoning Process]...\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many rational numbers between 0 and 1, when expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, result in the product of the numerator and denominator being \\(20!\\).\n\nGiven a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) in lowest terms, the product \\(a \\cdot b = 20!\\). Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be factors of \\(20!\\), and they must not have any common factors other than 1 (since the fraction is in lowest terms). \n\nThe number of such fractions is essentially the number of ways to split the prime factorization of \\(20!\\) between the numerator \\(a\\) and the denominator \\(b\\), under the constraint that \\(a < b\\) (since the fraction is between 0 and 1).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\):\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe total number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 78624\\]\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where \\(a = b = \\sqrt{20!}\\), because there is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 = 20!\\) (since \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square). For each valid pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), there is exactly one corresponding fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\frac{78624 - 1}{2} = 39311.5\\). Since we can't have half a pair, we take the integer part, which is 39311.\n\n[Verification]...\n\nLet's verify our reasoning using Python.

            "[Reasoning Process]...\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many rational numbers between 0 and 1, when expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, result in the product of the numerator and denominator being \\(20!\\).\n\nGiven a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) in lowest terms, the product \\(a \\cdot b = 20!\\). Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be factors of \\(20!\\), and they must not have any common factors other than 1 (since the fraction is in lowest terms). \n\nThe number of such fractions is essentially the number of ways to split the prime factorization of \\(20!\\) between the numerator \\(a\\) and the denominator \\(b\\), under the constraint that \\(a < b\\) (since the fraction is between 0 and 1).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\):\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe total number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 78624\\]\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where \\(a = b = \\sqrt{20!}\\), because there is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 = 20!\\) (since \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square). For each valid pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), there is exactly one corresponding fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\frac{78624 - 1}{2} = 39311.5\\). Since we can't have half a pair, we take the integer part, which is 39311.\n\n[Verification]...\n\nLet's verify our reasoning using Python. We'll calculate the number of divisors of \\(20!\\) and then count the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\).\n```python\nimport math\r\nfrom functools import reduce\r\nfrom collections import Counter\r\n\r\n# Function to compute the prime factorization of n!\r\ndef prime_factorization_factorial(n):\r\n    factors = Counter()\r\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\r\n        count = i\r\n        for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1):\r\n            if count % p == 0:\r\n                exp = 0\r\n                while count % p == 0:\r\n                    count //= p\r\n                    exp += 1\r\n                factors[p] += exp\r\n        if count > 1:\r\n            factors[count] += 1\r\n    return factors\r\n\r\n# Function to compute the number of divisors from prime factorization\r\ndef number_of_divisors(factors):\r\n    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, (exp + 1 for exp in factors.values()), 1)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the prime factorization of 20!\r\nfactors_20_fact = prime_factorization_factorial(20)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the number of divisors of 20!\r\nnum_divisors = number_of_divisors(factors_20_fact)\r\n\r\n# The number of valid pairs (a, b) where a < b\r\nnum_valid_pairs = (num_divisors - 1) // 2\r\n\r\nprint((factors_20_fact, num_divisors, num_valid_pairs))\n```\n```output\n(Counter({2: 18, 3: 8, 5: 4, 7: 2, 11: 1, 13: 1, 17: 1, 19: 1}), 97297200, 48648599)\n```\nIt appears there was an error in the computation of the number of divisors. The correct number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is much larger than \\(78624\\). Let's recompute the number of divisors more carefully and verify the calculation again.\n\nThe prime factorization of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe number of divisors is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 97297200\\]\n\nThis confirms that the number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is indeed \\(97297200\\). The number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\) is \\(\\frac{97297200 - 1}{2} = 48648599.5\\).

            "[Reasoning Process]...\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many rational numbers between 0 and 1, when expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, result in the product of the numerator and denominator being \\(20!\\).\n\nGiven a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) in lowest terms, the product \\(a \\cdot b = 20!\\). Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be factors of \\(20!\\), and they must not have any common factors other than 1 (since the fraction is in lowest terms). \n\nThe number of such fractions is essentially the number of ways to split the prime factorization of \\(20!\\) between the numerator \\(a\\) and the denominator \\(b\\), under the constraint that \\(a < b\\) (since the fraction is between 0 and 1).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\):\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe total number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 78624\\]\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where \\(a = b = \\sqrt{20!}\\), because there is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 = 20!\\) (since \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square). For each valid pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), there is exactly one corresponding fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\frac{78624 - 1}{2} = 39311.5\\). Since we can't have half a pair, we take the integer part, which is 39311.\n\n[Verification]...\n\nLet's verify our reasoning using Python.

            "[Reasoning Process]...\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many rational numbers between 0 and 1, when expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, result in the product of the numerator and denominator being \\(20!\\).\n\nGiven a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) in lowest terms, the product \\(a \\cdot b = 20!\\). Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be factors of \\(20!\\), and they must not have any common factors other than 1 (since the fraction is in lowest terms). \n\nThe number of such fractions is essentially the number of ways to split the prime factorization of \\(20!\\) between the numerator \\(a\\) and the denominator \\(b\\), under the constraint that \\(a < b\\) (since the fraction is between 0 and 1).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\):\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe total number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 78624\\]\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where \\(a = b = \\sqrt{20!}\\), because there is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 = 20!\\) (since \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square). For each valid pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), there is exactly one corresponding fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\frac{78624 - 1}{2} = 39311.5\\). Since we can't have half a pair, we take the integer part, which is 39311.\n\n[Verification]...\n\nLet's verify our reasoning using Python. We'll calculate the number of divisors of \\(20!\\) and then count the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\).\n```python\nimport math\r\nfrom functools import reduce\r\nfrom collections import Counter\r\n\r\n# Function to compute the prime factorization of n!\r\ndef prime_factorization_factorial(n):\r\n    factors = Counter()\r\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\r\n        count = i\r\n        for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1):\r\n            if count % p == 0:\r\n                exp = 0\r\n                while count % p == 0:\r\n                    count //= p\r\n                    exp += 1\r\n                factors[p] += exp\r\n        if count > 1:\r\n            factors[count] += 1\r\n    return factors\r\n\r\n# Function to compute the number of divisors from prime factorization\r\ndef number_of_divisors(factors):\r\n    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, (exp + 1 for exp in factors.values()), 1)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the prime factorization of 20!\r\nfactors_20_fact = prime_factorization_factorial(20)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the number of divisors of 20!\r\nnum_divisors = number_of_divisors(factors_20_fact)\r\n\r\n# The number of valid pairs (a, b) where a < b\r\nnum_valid_pairs = (num_divisors - 1) // 2\r\n\r\nprint((factors_20_fact, num_divisors, num_valid_pairs))\n```\n```output\n(Counter({2: 18, 3: 8, 5: 4, 7: 2, 11: 1, 13: 1, 17: 1, 19: 1}), 97297200, 48648599)\n```\nIt appears there was an error in the computation of the number of divisors. The correct number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is much larger than \\(78624\\). Let's recompute the number of divisors more carefully and verify the calculation again.\n\nThe prime factorization of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe number of divisors is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 97297200\\]\n\nThis confirms that the number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is indeed \\(97297200\\). The number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\) is \\(\\frac{97297200 - 1}{2} = 48648599.5\\).

            "[Reasoning Process]...\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many rational numbers between 0 and 1, when expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, result in the product of the numerator and denominator being \\(20!\\).\n\nGiven a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) in lowest terms, the product \\(a \\cdot b = 20!\\). Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be factors of \\(20!\\), and they must not have any common factors other than 1 (since the fraction is in lowest terms). \n\nThe number of such fractions is essentially the number of ways to split the prime factorization of \\(20!\\) between the numerator \\(a\\) and the denominator \\(b\\), under the constraint that \\(a < b\\) (since the fraction is between 0 and 1).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\):\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe total number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 78624\\]\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where \\(a = b = \\sqrt{20!}\\), because there is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 = 20!\\) (since \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square). For each valid pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), there is exactly one corresponding fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\frac{78624 - 1}{2} = 39311.5\\). Since we can't have half a pair, we take the integer part, which is 39311.\n\n[Verification]...\n\nLet's verify our reasoning using Python.

The correct number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is much larger than \\(78624\\).

            "[Reasoning Process]...\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many rational numbers between 0 and 1, when expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, result in the product of the numerator and denominator being \\(20!\\).\n\nGiven a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) in lowest terms, the product \\(a \\cdot b = 20!\\). Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be factors of \\(20!\\), and they must not have any common factors other than 1 (since the fraction is in lowest terms). \n\nThe number of such fractions is essentially the number of ways to split the prime factorization of \\(20!\\) between the numerator \\(a\\) and the denominator \\(b\\), under the constraint that \\(a < b\\) (since the fraction is between 0 and 1).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\):\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe total number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 78624\\]\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where \\(a = b = \\sqrt{20!}\\), because there is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 = 20!\\) (since \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square). For each valid pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), there is exactly one corresponding fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\frac{78624 - 1}{2} = 39311.5\\). Since we can't have half a pair, we take the integer part, which is 39311.\n\n[Verification]...\n\nLet's verify our reasoning using Python.

Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be factors of \\(20!\\), and they must not have any common factors other than 1 (since the fraction is in lowest terms). \n\nThe number of such fractions is essentially the number of ways to split the prime factorization of \\(20!\\) between the numerator \\(a\\) and the denominator \\(b\\), under the constraint that \\(a < b\\) (since the fraction is between 0 and 1).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\):\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe total number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 78624\\]\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where \\(a = b = \\sqrt{20!}\\), because there is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 = 20!\\) (since \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square). For each valid pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), there is exactly one corresponding fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\frac{78624 - 1}{2} = 39311.5\\).

For each prime factor, we need to ensure that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) do not share any prime factors.\n\nLet's recompute the number of valid pairs using the correct approach.

        "[Reasoning Process]...\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many rational numbers between 0 and 1, when expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, result in the product of the numerator and denominator being \\(20!\\).\n\nGiven a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) in lowest terms, the product \\(a \\cdot b = 20!\\). Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be factors of \\(20!\\), and they must not have any common factors other than 1 (since the fraction is in lowest terms). \n\nThe number of such fractions is essentially the number of ways to split the prime factorization of \\(20!\\) between the numerator \\(a\\) and the denominator \\(b\\), under the constraint that \\(a < b\\) (since the fraction is between 0 and 1).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\):\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe total number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 78624\\]\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where \\(a = b = \\sqrt{20!}\\), because there is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 = 20!\\) (since \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square). For each valid pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), there is exactly one corresponding fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\frac{78624 - 1}{2} = 39311.5\\). Since we can't have half a pair, we take the integer part, which is 39311.\n\n[Verification]...\n\nLet's verify our reasoning using Python. We'll calculate the number of divisors of \\(20!\\) and then count the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\).\n```python\nimport math\r\nfrom functools import reduce\r\nfrom collections import Counter\r\n\r\n# Function to compute the prime factorization of n!\r\ndef prime_factorization_factorial(n):\r\n    factors = Counter()\r\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\r\n        count = i\r\n        for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1):\r\n            if count % p == 0:\r\n                exp = 0\r\n                while count % p == 0:\r\n                    count //= p\r\n                    exp += 1\r\n                factors[p] += exp\r\n        if count > 1:\r\n            factors[count] += 1\r\n    return factors\r\n\r\n# Function to compute the number of divisors from prime factorization\r\ndef number_of_divisors(factors):\r\n    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, (exp + 1 for exp in factors.values()), 1)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the prime factorization of 20!\r\nfactors_20_fact = prime_factorization_factorial(20)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the number of divisors of 20!\r\nnum_divisors = number_of_divisors(factors_20_fact)\r\n\r\n# The number of valid pairs (a, b) where a < b\r\nnum_valid_pairs = (num_divisors - 1) // 2\r\n\r\nprint((factors_20_fact, num_divisors, num_valid_pairs))\n```\n```output\n(Counter({2: 18, 3: 8, 5: 4, 7: 2, 11: 1, 13: 1, 17: 1, 19: 1}), 97297200, 48648599)\n```\nIt appears there was an error in the computation of the number of divisors. The correct number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is much larger than \\(78624\\). Let's recompute the number of divisors more carefully and verify the calculation again.\n\nThe prime factorization of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe number of divisors is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 97297200\\]\n\nThis confirms that the number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is indeed \\(97297200\\). The number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\) is \\(\\frac{97297200 - 1}{2} = 48648599.5\\).

        "[Reasoning Process]...\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many rational numbers between 0 and 1, when expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, result in the product of the numerator and denominator being \\(20!\\).\n\nGiven a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) in lowest terms, the product \\(a \\cdot b = 20!\\). Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be factors of \\(20!\\), and they must not have any common factors other than 1 (since the fraction is in lowest terms). \n\nThe number of such fractions is essentially the number of ways to split the prime factorization of \\(20!\\) between the numerator \\(a\\) and the denominator \\(b\\), under the constraint that \\(a < b\\) (since the fraction is between 0 and 1).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(20!\\):\n\n\\[20! = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\\]\n\nThe total number of divisors of \\(20!\\) is:\n\n\\[(18+1)(8+1)(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 19 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 78624\\]\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where \\(a = b = \\sqrt{20!}\\), because there is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 = 20!\\) (since \\(20!\\) is not a perfect square). For each valid pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a < b\\), there is exactly one corresponding fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid pairs \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\frac{78624 - 1}{2} = 39311.5\\). Since we can't have half a pair, we take the integer part, which is 39311.\n\n[Verification]...\n\nLet's verify our reasoning using Python.

Each prime factor in the factorization can either be in the numerator or the denominator, but not both to ensure the fraction is in lowest terms.\n3. **Count Coprime Pairs:**\n   We need to count pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a < b\\), \\(a \\cdot b = 20!\\), and \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\).

This means that for each prime factor, we have 2 choices (either in \\(a\\) or in \\(b\\)). Thus, for \\(20!\\) with 8 prime factors, we have \\(2^8 = 256\\) ways to distribute these prime factors between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nHowever, since we need \\(a < b\\), each valid distribution of prime factors will generate exactly one valid pair \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a < b\\). Also, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be divisors of \\(20!\\) and their product is \\(20!\\), each valid distribution of prime factors will generate exactly one such pair.\n\n### Verification\nLet's write the code to verify this logic.
