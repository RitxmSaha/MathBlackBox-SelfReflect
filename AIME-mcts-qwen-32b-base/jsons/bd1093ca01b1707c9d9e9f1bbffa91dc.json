        "[reasoning process]\nThe sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are the sets of complex roots of unity, which specifically means that \\( z \\) in \\( A \\) and \\( w \\) in \\( B \\) are of the form:\n\n\\[ z = e^{2\\pi i k / 18} \\]\n\\[ w = e^{2\\pi i m / 48} \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) ranges from 0 to 17 and \\( m \\) ranges from 0 to 47. These \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) are the 18th and 48th roots of unity respectively.\n\nNow, consider the set \\( C = \\{zw : z \\in A \\text{ and } w \\in B\\} \\). Elements in \\( C \\) are given by:\n\n\\[ zw = e^{2\\pi i k / 18} \\times e^{2\\pi i m / 48} = e^{2\\pi i (k/18 + m/48)} \\]\n\nSimplifying the exponent:\n\n\\[ k/18 + m/48 = (k \\cdot 48 + m \\cdot 18) / (18 \\cdot 48) \\]\n\nLet's denote \\( n = k \\cdot 48 + m \\cdot 18 \\).
