The factor 99 can be factored into \\(9 \\times 11\\), and since 9 is already a perfect square, 11 must pair with another factor of 11 to make the entire fraction a perfect square. Thus, \\(x + y\\) and \\(x - y\\) must combine to ensure this. Given that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are digits, the only pairs (x, y) that satisfy this are (6, 5) and (5, 6).\n\nLet's test \\(x = 6\\) and \\(y = 5\\):\n\\[ AB = 10x + y = 65 \\]\n\\[ CD = 10y + x = 56 \\]\n\\[ r = \\frac{65}{2} \\]\n\\[ OH^2 = \\frac{99(6 + 5)(6 - 5)}{4} = \\frac{99 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 1}{4} = \\frac{1089}{4} = \\left(\\frac{33}{2}\\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ OH = \\frac{33}{2} \\]\nThis is a rational number, so the solution is valid. Therefore, the length of \\(AB\\) is 65.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the computation with Python code to ensure the accuracy.\n```python\n# Function to check the given conditions\ndef find_diameter():\n    for x in range(1, 10):\n        for y in range(0, 10):\n            AB = 10 * x + y\n            CD = 10 * y + x\n            r_squared = (AB / 2) ** 2\n            OH_squared = r_squared - (CD / 2) ** 2\n            OH_squared Rational = OH_squared.is_integer() and (OH_squared ** 0.5).is_integer() or (OH_squared ** 0.5).is_integer() * 2\n            if OH_squared >= 0 and OH_squared.is_integer():\n                OH = OH_squared ** 0.5\n                if OH.is_integer() or OH * 2 == int(OH * 2):\n                    return AB, OH\n\n# Find the diameter\ndiameter, distance_to_center = find_diameter()\nprint((diameter, distance_to_center))\n```\n```output\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\nIt looks like there was a syntax error in the code due to the incorrect usage of the `Rational` keyword and the `is_integer` method. Let's correct the code and simplify the verification process.\n\nWe'll check for each pair of digits (x, y) to see if the conditions are met, and specifically check if the computed \\(OH\\) is a rational number. We'll use a simpler approach to verify the conditions.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to check the given conditions\ndef find_diameter():\n    for x in range(1, 10):\n        for y in range(0, 10):\n            AB = 10 * x + y\n            CD = 10 * y + x\n            r_squared = (AB / 2) ** 2\n            OH_squared = r_squared - (CD / 2) ** 2\n            if OH_squared >= 0:\n                OH = math.sqrt(OH_squared)\n                if OH.is_integer() or OH * 2 == int(OH * 2):\n                    return AB, OH\n\n# Find the diameter\ndiameter, distance_to_center = find_diameter()\nprint((diameter, distance_to_center))\n```\n```output\n(65, 16.5)\n```\nThe diameter \\(AB\\) of the circle is \\(65\\), and the distance from the intersection point \\(H\\) to the center \\(O\\) is \\(16.5\\), which is a positive rational number. Therefore, the length of \\(AB\\) is indeed \\(\\boxed{65}\\)."
