            "[Analyst] While the reasoning and calculations presented are mostly correct, there are a few areas where the solution could be more rigorous or precise, and there are some minor issues with the format and presentation. \n\n1. **Introduction of Variables:** The problem introduces variables \\(\\tan x\\) and \\(\\tan y\\) but does not explicitly denote them with another substitution, which could aid in clarity. Using a substitution like \\(a = \\tan x\\) and \\(b = \\tan y\\) might make the steps cleaner.\n\n2. **Formatting of Key Steps:** The solution could benefit from better formatting of key equations. For example, the transition from \\(\\frac{25}{\\tan x \\tan y} = 30\\) to \\(\\tan x \\tan y = \\frac{5}{6}\\) could be clearer with a more explicit step-by-step transition.\n\n3. **Verification:** The verification steps are brief and not extremely detailed. A more detailed verification reflecting a re-evaluation of the steps taken to confirm the solution could improve the solution's rigor.\n\n4. **Justification for Key Steps:** While the steps are correct, some justification for key manipulations could be provided for full clarity, such as why substituting \\(\\frac{1}{\\tan x} + \\frac{1}{\\tan y} = 30\\) leads to \\(\\frac{\\tan x + \\tan y}{\\tan x \\tan y} = 30\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion is correct but could be presented more formally. For instance, stating the final answer in a boxed format or rephrasing it for emphasis could add clarity.\n\nGiven these minor but significant areas for improvement, the solution can be rated as exceptionally good but not perfect. \n\n[Score] -20"

            "[Analyst] The provided answer \"I don't know the answer to this question\" does not demonstrate any understanding or attempt to solve the given problem. It fails to show any process of reasoning, application of mathematical formulas, or even a recognition of the possibility of solving the problem by using the given equations. The student did not even attempt to derive any intermediate steps to find the tangent of x+y, despite having been given sufficient information to do so.\n\nThe student could have started by recalling that $\\cot x = \\frac{1}{\\tan x}$ and $\\cot y = \\frac{1}{\\tan y}$, and used these identities to express the second given equation in terms of $\\tan x$ and $\\tan y$. This would lead to $\\frac{1}{\\tan x} + \\frac{1}{\\tan y} = 30$, which can be rearranged into $\\frac{\\tan x + \\tan y}{\\tan x \\tan y} = 30$. Given that $\\tan x + \\tan y = 25$, this equation simplifies to $\\frac{25}{\\tan x \\tan y} = 30$, from which $\\tan x \\tan y = \\frac{25}{30} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nFinally, using the formula for the tangent of a sum, $\\tan(x+y) = \\frac{\\tan x + \\tan y}{1 - \\tan x \\tan y}$, the student could have plugged in the values $\\tan x + \\tan y = 25$ and $\\tan x \\tan y = \\frac{5}{6}$ to find $\\tan(x+y) = \\frac{25}{1 - \\frac{5}{6}} = \\frac{25}{\\frac{1}{6}} = 150$. \n\nThis methodical approach, which demonstrates an understanding of trigonometric identities and their applications, would have resulted in a correct solution.

We can use the trigonometric identity for the tangent of a sum of two angles, which is \\(\\tan(x+y) = \\frac{\\tan x + \\tan y}{1 - \\tan x \\tan y}\\). To use this identity, we need to determine the value of \\(\\tan x \\tan y\\).\n\nFirst, recall that \\(\\cot \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\tan \\theta}\\). The given \\(\\cot x + \\cot y = 30\\) can be rewritten in terms of \\(\\tan x\\) and \\(\\tan y\\) as:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\tan x} + \\frac{1}{\\tan y} = 30. \\]\n\nCombining these fractions, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{\\tan x + \\tan y}{\\tan x \\tan y} = 30. \\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\tan x + \\tan y = 25\\), substitute this into the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{25}{\\tan x \\tan y} = 30. \\]\n\nFrom this, we solve for \\(\\tan x \\tan y\\):\n\\[ \\tan x \\tan y = \\frac{25}{30} = \\frac{5}{6}. \\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\(\\tan x + \\tan y = 25\\) and \\(\\tan x \\tan y = \\frac{5}{6}\\) into the identity \\(\\tan(x+y) = \\frac{\\tan x + \\tan y}{1 - \\tan x \\tan y}\\):\n\\[ \\tan(x+y) = \\frac{25}{1 - \\frac{5}{6}} = \\frac{25}{\\frac{1}{6}} = 25 \\cdot 6 = 150. \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(\\tan(x+y)\\) is 150.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by checking the consistency with the original equations.\n\n1. We know \\(\\tan x + \\tan y = 25\\).\n2. We also know \\(\\frac{1}{\\tan x} + \\frac{1}{\\tan y} = 30\\), and substituting \\(\\tan x + \\tan y = 25\\) and solving for \\(\\tan x \\tan y\\) gave us \\(\\tan x \\tan y = \\frac{5}{6}\\).\n3. Plugging these values into the identity \\(\\tan(x+y) = \\frac{\\tan x + \\tan y}{1 - \\tan x \\tan y}\\) resulted in \\(\\tan(x+y) = 150\\).\n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 150 \\n#### 150"
