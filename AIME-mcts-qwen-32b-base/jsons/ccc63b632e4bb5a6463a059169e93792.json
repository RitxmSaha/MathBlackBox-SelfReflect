Start with \\( f(14, 52) \\):\n\\[ 52 = 4 \\cdot 14 + 0 \\]\n\nWe see that \\( 52 \\) can be written as \\( 4 \\cdot 14 + 0 \\), but we need a form where we can apply the recursive relation directly. So, we consider the next closest multiple:\n\\[ 52 = 3 \\cdot 14 + 10 \\]\n\\[ 10 = 14 - 4 \\]\n\nThus, we can rewrite \\( 52 \\) in terms of \\( 14 \\) and a smaller second argument:\n\\[ f(14, 52) = f(14, 3 \\cdot 14 + 10) \\]\n\nNow, using the recursive relation:\n\\[ (14 + 10)f(14, 10) = 10f(14, 24) \\]\n\\[ f(14, 24) = \\frac{24f(14, 10)}{10} \\]\n\nSimilarly, we can reduce \\( f(14, 24) \\):\n\\[ 24 = 1 \\cdot 14 + 10 \\]\n\\[ f(14, 24) = f(14, 10 + 14) \\]\n\\[ (14 + 10)f(14, 10) = 10f(14, 24) \\]\n\\[ f(14, 10) = \\frac{10}{24}f(14, 24) \\]\n\nAnd so on.
