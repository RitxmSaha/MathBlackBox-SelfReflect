        "[Reasoning process] To solve this problem, we need to find the square of the distance from point \\( B \\) to the center \\( O \\) of the circle. We can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Coordinate Setup**:\n   - Place the center of the circle \\( O \\) at the origin \\((0, 0)\\).\n   - Point \\( A \\) lies on the circle and can be represented in polar coordinates as \\( (r \\cos \\theta, r \\sin \\theta) \\), where \\( r = \\sqrt{50} \\).\n   - Since \\( \\angle AOB = 45^\\circ \\) (from the problem geometry), we can write \\( A \\) as \\( (\\sqrt{50} \\cos 45^\\circ, \\sqrt{50} \\sin 45^\\circ) = (\\sqrt{25}, \\sqrt{25}) = (5, 5) \\).\n\n2. **Finding Point \\( B \\)**:\n   - Since \\( B \\) is 6 cm directly below \\( A \\), its coordinates are \\( (5, 5 - 6) = (5, -1) \\).\n\n3. **Finding Point \\( C \\)**:\n   - Point \\( C \\) is 2 cm to the right of \\( B \\) and lies on the circle. So, its coordinates are \\( (5 + 2, -1) = (7, -1) \\).\n   - Since \\( C \\) lies on the circle, its distance from the origin \\( O \\) must be equal to the radius \\( \\sqrt{50} \\). We can verify this by checking if \\( \\sqrt{7^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{50} \\).\n\n4. **Distance Calculation**:\n   - We need to find the square of the distance from \\( B \\) to \\( O \\). The distance formula between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by \\( \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\).\n   - Here, the distance from \\( B (5, -1) \\) to \\( O (0, 0) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{5^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 1} = \\sqrt{26} \\).\n   - The square of this distance is \\( 26 \\).\n\n[Verification]:\nThe coordinates of \\( B \\) are \\( (5, -1) \\). The distance from \\( B \\) to the origin \\( O \\) is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\sqrt{5^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 1} = \\sqrt{26} \\]\nThe square of this distance is \\( 26 \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\( 26 \\)\n#### 26"
