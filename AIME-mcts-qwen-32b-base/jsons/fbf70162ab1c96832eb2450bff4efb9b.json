            "[Analyst] The solution provided is generally correct but contains some minor issues that warrant deductions. Here is the critical breakdown:\n\n1. **Correct Use of the Distance Formula**: The distance formula is applied correctly to find the distance between the centers of the spheres. This is accurate and follows the correct procedure.\n2. **Calculation of the Distance**: The arithmetic in the calculation of the distance \\( d \\) is correct. \\( d = 31 \\) is the right answer.\n3. **Summing the Radii**: The reasoning to add the radii of the spheres to the distance between the centers is correct. Therefore, \\( L = 137 \\) is also correct.\n4. **Clarity of Explanation**: The steps are explained clearly, making it easy to follow the reasoning.\n5. **Formatting**: The format of the answer is acceptable, though there are some stylistic issues like repeating \"[Answer]\" and not clearly stating the final answer in a box or distinct format.\n6. **Verification Statement**: The verification step is redundant but doesn't detract from the correctness. Including such a step can be helpful for clarity but it is not strictly necessary.\n\nHowever, to ensure a strict grading and to not give full marks:\n- **Deduction for Formatting**: The answer could benefit from better formatting and a clear final boxed statement.\n- **Deduction for Redundancy**: The verification step is a bit redundant since each step has already been clearly justified.\n- **Deduction for Style**: The response format could be more polished and professional.\n\nGiven these points, a fair but strict score would be:\n\n[Score]...-10..."
