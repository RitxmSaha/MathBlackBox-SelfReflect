A valid sequence is one where no two heads are consecutive.\n\nA valid sequence of length \\(n\\) can end in either a tail (T) or a head (H). If it ends in a tail, the preceding \\(n-1\\) tosses can be any valid sequence of length \\(n-1\\). If it ends in a head, the preceding toss must be a tail, and the preceding \\(n-2\\) tosses can be any valid sequence of length \\(n-2\\).\n\nThus, we have the recurrence relation:\n\\[\na_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\n\\]\nwith initial conditions \\(a_1 = 2\\) (the sequences are H and T) and \\(a_2 = 3\\) (the sequences are HT, TH, and TT).\n\nWe can now compute the values of \\(a_n\\) up to \\(a_{10}\\):\n\\[\na_1 = 2\n\\]\n\\[\na_2 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\na_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5\n\\]\n\\[\na_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\na_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13\n\\]\n\\[\na_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 13 + 8 = 21\n\\]\n\\[\na_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 21 + 13 = 34\n\\]\n\\[\na_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 34 + 21 = 55\n\\]\n\\[\na_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 55 + 34 = 89\n\\]\n\\[\na_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 89 + 55 = 144\n\\]\nSo, the number of valid sequences of length 10 is \\(a_{10} = 144\\).\n\nThe total number of possible sequences of 10 coin tosses is \\(2^{10} = 1024\\). Therefore, the probability that heads never occur on consecutive tosses is:\n\\[\n\\frac{144}{1024} = \\frac{9}{64}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\frac{9}{64}\\) is already in lowest terms, we have \\(i = 9\\) and \\(j = 64\\). Thus, \\(i + j = 9 + 64 = 73\\).\n\n[Verification]\nThe recurrence relation and initial conditions are well-defined and correctly computed. The probability \\(\\frac{9}{64}\\) is in its simplest form, and the sum \\(i + j\\) is correctly calculated as 73.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 73 \n#### 73"
