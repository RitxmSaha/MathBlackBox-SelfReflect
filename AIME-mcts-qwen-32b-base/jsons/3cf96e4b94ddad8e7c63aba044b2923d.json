There are no apparent flaws in the reasoning, transformations, or algebraic manipulations. The answer is accurate based on the steps provided.\n\nHowever, if the answer is considered weak, it might be due to the lack of verification of the reflection formulas or the inclusion of additional steps to validate the form of the final equation.
