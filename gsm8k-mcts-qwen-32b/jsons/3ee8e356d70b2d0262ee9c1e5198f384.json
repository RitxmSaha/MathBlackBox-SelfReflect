            "[Analyst] The solution is generally correct and clearly articulated, but there are several minor issues that could be improved to warrant a perfect score:\n\n1. **Clarity of Explanation**: While the explanation is mostly clear, it could benefit from a bit more explicit transition between steps. Specifically, the sentences \"This means if the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, the levels below it (Level 3, Level 2, and Level 1) will have double the square footage of the level directly above them\" can be a bit confusing. A clearer statement like \"Since each level has half the square footage of the level immediately below it, the top level (Level 4) having 16 square feet means that Level 3 will have 32 square feet, Level 2 will have 64 square feet, and Level 1 will have 128 square feet\" would be preferable.\n\n2. **Usage of \"Verification\" Section**: The \"Verification\" section is good for reinforcing the calculations but could be better integrated into the solution. Verifying the calculations within the solution itself, immediately after finding the sum, would strengthen the response.\n\n3. **Formatting**: The response format could be slightly more consistent and professional. For instance, using a comma to separate the units in large numbers (e.g., 128 instead of 128) would improve readability.\n\n4. **Final Answer Presentation**: The final answer should be clearly labeled. Instead of `[Final Answer] The answer is 60`, it would be more formal to state `Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 60 square feet.`\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The response could end with a clear and concise conclusion to wrap up the solution, such as \"Thus, the average square footage of a level is 60 square feet.\"\n\nTaking these points into account, the response is exemplary but not perfect. There is room for improvement in clarity, integration of verification, and presentation. \n\n[Score]...-20..."

            "[Analyst] The response provided does not address the problem at all. The student did not attempt to solve the problem, instead stating \"I don't know how to solve this question,\" which indicates a lack of engagement and understanding with the problem. To solve the problem, one should recognize that the square footage of each level is halved as you move down. Given the top level has a square footage of 16, the next level would be 32 (since 16 is half of 32), the level below that would be 64, and the bottom level would be 128. The average square footage would then be calculated by summing these values and dividing by the number of levels: (16 + 32 + 64 + 128) / 4 = 240 / 4 = 60. The student's response demonstrates a complete failure to engage with the mathematical reasoning required to solve the problem. Given this, no partial credit can be considered.\n\n[Score] -95..."
