            "[Analyst] The answer provided contains a thorough solution with a clear step-by-step breakdown. However, there are several minor issues that could be improved upon to make the solution more precise and mathematically rigorous. Here are the specific critiques:\n\n1. **Terminology and Notation:**\n   - The term \"a few episodes\" in the question is speculative. The solution assumes \"a few\" means a variable number but this is not clearly stated. While it's implied, a direct statement could be clearer.\n   - The notation for the total viewing time on Wednesday could be more precise. Instead of using \\( x \\) for the number of episodes, explicitly state it as \\( y = 30x/60 \\) or \\( y = x \\times 0.5 \\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Clarity:**\n   - While the math is correct, the presentation could benefit from being more formal. Instead of saying \"Let's assume he watched x episodes of 30 minutes each\", use mathematical notation or formal language.\n   - The equation setup is correct, but could include more intermediate steps for clarity.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - The verification step is good for ensuring the solution but could be more detailed, breaking down each day's viewing hours in a structured table to avoid potential misinterpretation.\n\n4. **Final Presentation:**\n   - The final answer is well-stated but could include a brief conclusion or summary sentence.\n   - The answer is boxed but could be clearly labeled for emphasis (e.g., \"The number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 3.\").\n\nGiven these critiques, the solution is accurate but could benefit from additional clarity and formality. Therefore, it does not deserve a perfect score but is close to being excellent.\n[Score]...-5..."
