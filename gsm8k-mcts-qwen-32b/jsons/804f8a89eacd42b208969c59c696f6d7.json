When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?",
    "ground_truth": "Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.\nHe had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.\nTherefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.\n#### 50",

        "[Reasoning process]...Henry's current number of cookies is 110, but 5 of them were dropped. So, before the accident, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies. According to the problem, he baked 15 more cookies than he intended to, meaning he was aiming to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies. Now, we know that this number, 100, is double what he baked last year. So, the amount baked last year is 100 / 2 = 50 cookies.\n\n[Verification]...If Henry baked 50 cookies last year, this year (under normal circumstances) he would have wanted to make 50 * 2 = 100 cookies.

The logic is clear and correct, starting from identifying the number of cookies before the 5 were dropped and then reversing the steps to find the original intent and last year's output.\n2. However, the verification step is somewhat redundant and could be clearer. It should re-emphasize how the original conditions in the problem statement are met with the calculated answer.\n3. The formatting of the \"Answer\" is inconsistent and could be more structured for clarity.\n4.
