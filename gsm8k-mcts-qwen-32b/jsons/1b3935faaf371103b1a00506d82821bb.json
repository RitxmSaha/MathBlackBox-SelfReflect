            "[Analyst] The solution provided is mostly correct in terms of the process and calculations, but there are a few areas where improvements could be made. \n\n1. **Terminology and Precision**: The answer could benefit from more precise language. For example, the question asks how much Artie will make, but the final answer is presented without a currency symbol or appropriate phrasing. The final answer should be phrased as \"$88\" instead of just \"88.\"\n\n2. **Formatting and Clarity**: The final answer is marked as #### 88, which is not a standard format for presenting answers in most contexts. It could be simply stated as \"$88\" in a clear and concise manner.\n\n3. **Verification Section**: While the verification section is thorough, it might be seen as repetitive given that the calculations have already been presented earlier. The verification could be shortened or omitted to make the response more concise.\n\n4. **Grading Rubric**: The grading rubric was not explicitly mentioned or applied, which means the score might not be based on a clear set of criteria if this were part of a larger assessment.\n\n[Score]-20"

            "[Analyst] The provided answer \"I Don't Know\" is completely incorrect and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the problem. The question requires a straightforward calculation involving rounding prices and then multiplying by the number of pots sold. Not attempting to solve the problem and instead giving up by stating \"I Don't Know\" is unacceptable.\n\nTo solve the problem:\n1. Round each flower price to the nearest dollar:\n   - Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00\n   - Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00\n   - Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00\n2. Multiply the rounded prices by the number of pots sold:\n   - Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00\n   - Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 = $18.00\n   - Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 = $34.00\n3. Sum the amounts: $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00\n\nTherefore, Artie will make $88.00.\n\nGiven the severity of the error and the complete lack of attempt to solve the problem, the score should be very low. However, since we are instructed not to give full marks to ensure that grades are authoritative, we will assign a score that is well below zero but not the absolute minimum. \n\n[-100]"
