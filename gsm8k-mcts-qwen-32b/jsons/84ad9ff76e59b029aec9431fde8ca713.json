    "ground_truth": "A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.\nSo, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.\nThe total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.\nThus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.\n#### 255",

            "[Analyst] The solution provided is mostly correct, but there are several points that could be improved:\n\n1. **Steps Clarity**: The steps are clear but could be more detailed. For example, explicitly stating the formula used for interest calculation might help.\n2. **Unit Clarification**: Mentioning the units (percentage) for the interest rate would improve clarity.\n3. **Verification Process**: While the verification step is good, it should be more structured. Specifying what is being checked would make it clearer.\n4. **Final Answer Presentation**: The final answer should be more formally presented. For example, stating it more explicitly as \"Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months\" would be more professional.\n5. **Explanatory Text**: The transition between calculations could be smoother with better linking sentences.\n6. **Formatting**: Consistent formatting (e.g., all monetary values with $ symbol) would enhance readability.\n\nGiven these points, while the core calculation is correct, the presentation and clarity could be significantly improved.\n\n[Score]-25"

            "[Analyst] The provided answer is completely incorrect and fails to address the core aspects of the question. The responder simply stated \"I don't know the answer to this question, sorry,\" without attempting to calculate the monthly payment, despite the fact that the necessary information to do so was provided. This response shows a lack of basic analytical skills and problem-solving ability. There is no effort or reasoning shown to justify the statement. The answer should have included the total cost of the phones including interest, and then divided by the number of installments to determine the monthly payment. Therefore, the score is significantly low due to the complete lack of effort and demonstrated mathematical ability. [Score]...-99..."
