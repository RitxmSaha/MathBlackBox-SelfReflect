The question asks for the total number of bolts of fiber required to make a robe, specifying that it needs 2 bolts of blue fiber and half as much white fiber. The correct calculation would be: 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber (which is half of 2) = 3 bolts of fiber in total. The response given, however, simply states that the assistant cannot help, which is incorrect and uninformative. This response shows a lack of understanding of the problem and fails to provide any useful information or solution. Therefore, it deserves a very low score. [-95]"
