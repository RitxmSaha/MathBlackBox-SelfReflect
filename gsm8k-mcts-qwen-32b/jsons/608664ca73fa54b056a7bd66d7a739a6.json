            "[Analyst] The reasoning process is logically sound and follows a clear step-by-step approach to solving the problem. However, there are a few areas where improvements could be made to ensure a more comprehensive and precise answer:\n\n1. **Units Consistency:** There is no explicit mention of units for speed (miles per hour) in the intermediate steps. It would be clearer to include units throughout the calculations.\n   \n2. **Verification Section:** While the verification section is correct, it could be more detailed. For example, explicitly stating the running speed on each day and then summing it up could strengthen the verification.\n   \n3. **Final Answer Presentation:** The final answer is presented as an integer (10), but it might be better to present it as \"10 miles per hour\" to ensure clarity.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Clarity:** The step-by-step process is clear, but a brief reiteration of the final calculation could emphasize the result.\n\n5. **Formatting:** The formatting of the final answer is inconsistent with the provided response format.\n\nConsidering these points, the answer is nearly perfect but could benefit from some additional clarity and formatting improvements.\n\n[Score]-5"
