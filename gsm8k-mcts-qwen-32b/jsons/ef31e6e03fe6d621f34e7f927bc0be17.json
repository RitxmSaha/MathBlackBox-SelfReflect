        "[Reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of apple pie pieces that Grandma Jones made. Since she baked 5 pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, we multiply 5 by 8 to find the total number of pieces. This gives us 40 pieces.

            "[Analyst] The reasoning process is clear and methodical, correctly identifying the initial total number of pie pieces and the number of pieces remaining. The calculation is accurate, and the final answer is correct. However, there are minor issues with the presentation and structure of the response:\n1. The response could be more concise and clearly divided into sections for the reasoning, verification, and final answer.\n2. The verification step is labeled unnecessarily, as the step-by-step reasoning already includes the verification process.\n3. The final answer should be presented in a more noticeable way, such as a bolded or separately boxed result.\n4. There is a minor typographical error in the \"Response format\" section (\"ig.\" instead of \"i.e.\").\n5. The score should be presented within the specified format, with exact square brackets around \"Score\" and the numerical score within.\nGiven these points, the response is nearly perfect but falls short of a perfect score due to the minor issues mentioned.\n[Score]-10"

            "[Analyst] The response \"I can't understand this question\" demonstrates a lack of engagement with the problem and fails to provide any attempt at solving it. Given that the question is straightforward and involves basic arithmetic operations, this response shows a significant absence of effort and understanding. The respondent does not even attempt to break down the problem or identify any key pieces of information, such as the total number of pie pieces available initially or the number of pieces remaining. A more detailed and structured approach would involve identifying the total number of pie pieces (5 pies × 8 slices/pie = 40 slices), and then subtracting the 14 pieces that were left to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests (40 - 14 = 26 pieces). Such a response would show an understanding of the task and the ability to apply basic mathematics to solve a problem. Therefore, the response deserves a very low score.\n\n[Score] -95"
