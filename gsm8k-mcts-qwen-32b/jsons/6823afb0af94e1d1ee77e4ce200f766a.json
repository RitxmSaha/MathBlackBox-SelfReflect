        "[Reasoning process]\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. First, find the number of boys in the 200 Grade 5 students. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 200 = 80\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the number of girls. Since we already know the total number of students and the number of boys, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120\n   \\]\n\n3. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so we calculate the number of girls in the scout as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 120 = 80\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the scout from the total number of girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, let's ensure our calculations align with the given data. \n- Total students = 200\n- Boys = 80\n- Girls = 120\n- Girls in the scouts = (2/3) of girls = 80\n- Girls not in scouts = 120 - 80 = 40\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40\n#### 40",
