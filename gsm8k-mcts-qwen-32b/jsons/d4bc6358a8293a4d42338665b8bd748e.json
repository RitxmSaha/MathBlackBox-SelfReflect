            "[Analyst]...The answer provided is mostly correct in terms of the calculations and reasoning. However, there are several issues that detract from the quality of the response:\n\n1. The reasoning process could be more detailed and structured. It is a bit abrupt, and steps could be broken down more clearly.\n2. The verification process, while correct, is presented in an unnecessarily formal manner and could have been simplified to enhance understanding.\n3. The formatting of the final answer is inconsistent with common standards. It includes a redundant \"n#### 3\" at the end, which is not standard and could confuse the reader.\n4. There is a lack of concluding statement summarizing the final result in a clear and direct manner.\n\nGiven these issues, the response is solid but lacks in presentation, structure, and final clarity.\n\n[Score]...-10"

            "[Analyst] The provided answer is completely incorrect and does not address the question at all. The answer should involve calculating how many times Peter can afford to go to the movies with his given budget, considering the cost of both the ticket and popcorn each time. The given budget is $42, and each movie outing costs $7 for the ticket plus $7 for the popcorn, totaling $14 per outing. By dividing the budget by the cost per outing, we can determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies. The analysis is entirely missing, and the response shows a lack of understanding of the problem and the arithmetic required to solve it. Furthermore, the answer provided does not follow the instruction to be harsh and critical in the grading. Since the answer is not just wrong but also shows a lack of effort and thought process, the score should be very low.\n\n[Score]...-95..."
