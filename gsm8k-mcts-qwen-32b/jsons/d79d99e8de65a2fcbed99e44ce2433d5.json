The reasoning process is solid, but the final answer is not explicitly highlighted with a title or a distinct notation, which could be improved for clarity. Additionally, the verification step is thorough but could be more concise if it directly references the key values (e.g., 60 yogurts * $1.25) to make the rechecking process clearer. Lastly, the final answer should be more clearly separated from the verification and the preceding text. \n\n[Score]-20"
