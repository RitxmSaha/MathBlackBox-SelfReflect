This would make it easier to follow the reasoning.\n\n2. **Verification Section**: The verification section is somewhat redundant and could be more concise. It restates the steps without adding new insights.\n\n3. **Problem-Solving Approach**: While the approach is correct, the solution could benefit from a more detailed explanation of why each step is necessary, especially for someone who might not be familiar with solving such problems.\n\n4. **Final Answer Presentation**: The final answer is presented in a way that could be clearer. It's good to restate the final answer in a complete sentence or a more formal manner.\n\n5. **Mathematical Notation**: There are some minor issues with mathematical notation. For example, it would be clearer to write \"Number of dogs = 60\" rather than \"60 (\\text{dogs})\" in the total pets calculation.\n\nConsidering these points, the solution is accurate, but it lacks some clarity and detail which are important for a high score.\n\n[Score]...-20"
