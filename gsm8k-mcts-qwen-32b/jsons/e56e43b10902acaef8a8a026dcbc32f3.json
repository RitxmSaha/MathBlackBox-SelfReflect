            "[Analyst] The solution correctly calculates the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and packages of 2. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made to ensure clarity and correctness:\n\n1. The reasoning for the package of 2 flowers could be improved. The text states, \"Since 18 is not divisible by 2,\" which is incorrect; 18 is indeed divisible by 2 exactly 9 times. This statement might confuse readers.\n2. The verification section is necessary but could be clearer in its phrasing and logical flow.\n3. The final answer could benefit from a sentence summarizing the result to affirm the savings amount.\n4. The output format for the score should be explicitly stated as per the response format requirement.\n\n[Score]-20"
