        "[Reasoning process]... Ted needs to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for the dinosaurs at the picnic.

            "[Analyst] The response provided is clear and logical, but there are a few areas where it can be improved to deserve a higher score. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Formatting**: While the steps are clearly presented, the format could be more standardized. For example, using a consistent format for equations and calculations would improve readability.\n2. **Verification**: The verification step is brief and could be expanded to show a more detailed check of the calculations. For instance, breaking down the arithmetic steps in the verification part.\n3. **Terminology**: The use of \"adult dinosaur\" and \"child dinosaur\" is correct but could be improved to \"adults\" and \"children\" as they are already specified as dinosaurs in the context.\n4. **Final Answer**: The final answer is provided clearly, but it could be wrapped in a boxed output or highlighted for easier identification.\n\nGiven these points, the response is quite good but not perfect.
