            "[Analyst] The response is generally correct and logically sound, but there are some minor issues and areas for improvement that could lower the score:\n\n1. **Formatting and Clarity**: The answer could be more clearly formatted. It jumps directly to the final answer at the end without a clear concluding statement or a summary. Clarity and proper formatting are crucial for a well-structured solution.\n   \n2. **Verification Language**: The verification step could be more precise and professional. Instead of saying \"we can verify this by adding,\" it would be more formal to say, \"we can verify the calculation by adding.\"\n   \n3. **Consistency in Numbering**: The breakdown of the process could be more consistent. The final answer is introduced with \"The answer is 60,\" but \"#### 60\" is a bit jarring and disrupts the flow.\n   \n4. **Detail in Reasoning**: While the reasoning is correct, providing a bit more detail in the initial setup could enhance the explanation. For example, explicitly stating the variables could be helpful.\n   \n5. **Redundancy**: The phrase \"The answer is 60\" followed directly by \"#### 60\" is redundant. One or the other should suffice.\n   \n6. **Punctuation and Grammar**: There is a missing period at the end of the verification step.\n\n[Score]-20"

Given that no steps or reasoning were provided, this answer cannot be considered as demonstrating any understanding of the problem.\n\nMoreover, the question can be solved relatively straightforwardly using simple algebra or arithmetic, and there are no ambiguities within it.
