The user has not made any effort to break down the problem, calculate the number of doorbell rings for each friend, or provide a final total. The explanation given fails to address any part of the required analysis and calculations. The user should have calculated how many times each friend pressed the doorbell, starting with the fourth friend (60 times), then the third friend (60 + 10 = 70 times), the second friend (20 + (1/4 * 20) = 25 times), and finally, adding the first friend's 20 presses.
