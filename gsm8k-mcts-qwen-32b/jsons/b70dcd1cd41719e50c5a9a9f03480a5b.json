    "ground_truth": "If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.\nIf two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.\nIf one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.\n#### 18",

The link between her skipping speed and walking speed should be more explicit in the context of the problem.\n\n3. **Verification Section:**\n   - The verification section reiterates the calculations, but it whispers to the reader more than it asserts. Stronger assertions and clear checks need to be made especially for the totals.\n\n4. **Formatting:**\n   - The formatting could be improved with better usage of bullet points or paragraphs to separate logical sections and enhance readability.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - The final answer is presented as \"18,\" but there is no clear conclusion stating the final distance.
