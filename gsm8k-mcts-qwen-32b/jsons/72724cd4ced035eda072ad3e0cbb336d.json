            "[Analyst] The solution provided is generally correct, but there are a few points that could be improved for clarity and completeness. Firstly, the problem initially asks for the number of years before Carlos starts earning money, and the analysis correctly calculates that this point is reached in the 13th year. However, the transition from the inequality to the final answer is not as rigorous as it could be. The reasoning should explicitly state that since \\( n > 12 \\), the smallest integer value for \\( n \\) that satisfies this inequality is \\( n = 13 \\). \n\nSecondly, the verification step could be more detailed. While the verification is correct, it would be better to explain that the revenue at \\( n = 12 \\) is just equal to the costs, and at \\( n = 13 \\), the revenue exceeds the costs, which explicitly shows why \\( n = 13 \\) is the correct answer.\n\nLastly, the output format could be improved for clarity. The final answer should be clearly stated in a sentence or boxed format, which increases readability.\n\n[Score] -10"
