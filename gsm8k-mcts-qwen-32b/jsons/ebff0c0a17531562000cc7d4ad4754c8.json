            "[Analyst] The response starts with a logical breakdown but quickly descends into confusion. Initially, it correctly states that each school sends 6 people per team, totaling 12 people per school. However, the reasoning process then incorrectly multiplies 6 people by 4 schools, leading to an answer of 24, which shows a basic miscalculation or misinterpretation.\n\nThe verification section attempts to correct this but again misinterprets the initial calculation, showing a lack of clarity and consistency. The final answer is correct (48 people), but the journey to get there is fraught with errors and unclear reasoning.\n\nGiven the multiple mistakes in the provided reasoning and the overall lack of coherence, the score should reflect these issues.\n\n[Score]...-50..."
