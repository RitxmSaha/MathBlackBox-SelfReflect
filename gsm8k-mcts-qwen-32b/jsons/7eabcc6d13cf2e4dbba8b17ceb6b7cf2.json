        "[Reasoning process] Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, so the total number of eggs used for these purposes is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. This means she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell at the farmers' market. Selling these 9 eggs at $2 per egg gives her 9 * $2 = $18 per day.\n\n[Verification] A quick check confirms that where 16 total eggs - 7 eggs (3 for breakfast + 4 for muffins) = 9 eggs, selling 9 eggs at $2 each equals $18 per day. The reasoning aligns correctly with the scenario given.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18 \n#### 18",

            "[Analyst] The solution provided contains a logical error and lacks clarity in the explanation and format. First, the initial statement that Janet lays 16 eggs per day is incorrect based on the problem statement, as Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day, not Janet herself. Second, the answer provided, though mathematically correct ($18), is presented with minimal elaboration and justification, and the final output is incorrectly formatted as \"#### 18\" instead of [Final Answer] 18. The verification section is fine, but redundant and not necessary for a straightforward solution. The harsh grading criteria dictate that full marks should not be given. \n\n[Score] -20"

It simply states that the responder cannot help, which is incorrect. A step-by-step calculation should have been provided to determine the number of eggs sold and the corresponding earnings. Here's the correct calculation:\nJanet starts with 16 eggs per day.\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast: 16 - 3 = 13 eggs remaining.\nShe uses 4 eggs for muffins: 13 - 4 = 9 eggs remaining.\nShe sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each: 9_eggs * $2/egg = $18.\nThe answer should have been: Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n[Score] -85"
