            "[Analyst] The reasoning process is clear and logical, and the solution is correct. However, there are a few minor issues that can be critiqued to ensure the marks are authoritative:\n\n1. **Formatting and Structure**: The solution would benefit from clearer separation between the reasoning, verification, and final answer. Current formatting is somewhat mixed, which could be confusing to someone reading it quickly.\n2. **Assumptions**: The solution assumes that the only possible outcomes are wins and losses, ignoring the possibility of draws. While this is a reasonable assumption given the problem statement, it could be stated explicitly.\n3. **Verification**: While the verification is correct, it could be more detailed. For example, stating that the solution satisfies both conditions given in the problem individually could add clarity.\n4. **Presentation of Final Answer**: The final answer could be presented more clearly and distinctly. Instead of just \"15\", it would be better to say, \"The number of games won is 15.\"\n\nGiven these points, while the solution is fundamentally correct, the execution can be improved for clarity and detail.\n\n[Score]-20"

            "[Analyst] The provided answer does not attempt to solve the problem at all. It simply states that the responder cannot help, which is incorrect for this type of question. The problem requires setting up an equation based on the information given and then solving for the number of games won. The correct approach would be to define variables, set up the equation, solve it, and then provide the answer.\n\nLet's outline the correct method:\n1. Let \\( W \\) be the number of games won.\n2. Let \\( L \\) be the number of games lost.\n3. According to the problem, \\( W = L + 8 \\).\n4. Since there were 22 games in total, \\( W + L = 22 \\).\n5. Substitute the first equation into the second: \\( (L + 8) + L = 22 \\) which simplifies to \\( 2L + 8 = 22 \\).\n6. Solve for \\( L \\): \\( 2L = 14 \\) so \\( L = 7 \\).\n7. Substitute \\( L \\) back into the first equation to find \\( W \\): \\( W = 7 + 8 = 15 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the team won 15 games.\n\nSince the provided answer fails to attempt solving the problem and simply states an inability to do so, it merits a very low score.
