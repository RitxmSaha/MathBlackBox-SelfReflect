            "[Analyst] The reasoning process is clear and logical, but there are a few minor issues that could be improved:\n1. The explanation for the weekend consumption could be more precise, as John does have water with breakfast and lunch, but no water with dinner. This is correctly accounted for (1+1+0+1=3), but the wording could be clearer.\n2. The verification step is good, but it could be more detailed by explicitly stating the calculations for weekdays and weekends.\n3. The final answer could be framed more precisely by clearly stating, \"Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 26.\"\n\nDespite these minor issues, the solution is mostly accurate and easy to follow. However, due to the minor criticisms, I would not give full marks.\n\n[Score]...-10..."

            "[Analyst] The provided answer is entirely incorrect and fails to demonstrate any calculation or understanding of the problem. The answer should include a step-by-step breakdown of how many glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends, and then sum them up for the entire week. Here's a detailed breakdown of what should have been included:\n\n1. On weekdays (Monday to Friday), John drinks 4 glasses of water each day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). So for 5 days, it would be 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water.\n2. On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 3 glasses of water each day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) and a soda with dinner. So for 2 days, it would be 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water.\n3. The total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week would be 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26 glasses.\n\nThe given answer simply states that the person doesn't know the answer, which shows a lack of effort and understanding of the question.
