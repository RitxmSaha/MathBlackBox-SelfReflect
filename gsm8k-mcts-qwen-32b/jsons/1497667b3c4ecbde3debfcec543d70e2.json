            "[Analyst] The answer provided is generally correct, but there are several areas where improvements could be made to meet a higher standard:\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: The reasoning process is clear and follows a logical sequence, but it could be more detailed and structured. Each step should be clearly defined with explicit labels or subheadings for diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.\n2. **Verification**: The verification process is good, but it could be more thorough and explicitly state the conditions given in the problem to ensure that each calculation aligns with the problem's constraints.\n3. **Formatting**: The final answer and intermediate steps are correctly formatted, but consistency in formatting (e.g., using equations or bullet points) would enhance readability.\n4. **Potential for Error**: While the calculations are correct, there is no discussion of potential sources of error or how to handle them (e.g., rounding, unexpected values).\n5. **Generalization**: The solution does not generalize the problem or discuss any broader implications, which could be valuable in a more comprehensive solution.\n\nGiven these points, the solution is satisfactory but not exceptional.\n\n[Score] -20"

            "[Analyst] The response \"I Don't Know\" is completely incorrect and evades the problem entirely. The question provides enough information to calculate the total number of gems. Here's a proper breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. The number of diamonds is given as 175.\n2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies = 175 - 35 = 140.\n3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds = 2 * 140 = 280.\n4. The total number of gems = number of diamonds + number of rubies + number of emeralds = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.\n\nGiven the response, no effort was put into solving the problem or understanding how to derive the answer. The response reflects a lack of engagement with the question and does not demonstrate any mathematical ability or problem-solving skills. \n\n[Score] -85"
