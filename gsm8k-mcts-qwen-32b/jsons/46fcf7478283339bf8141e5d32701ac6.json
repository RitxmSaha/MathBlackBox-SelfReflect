            "[Analyst] The solution provided is correct in terms of the logical steps and calculations. However, let's critically analyze the response to find any flaws or imperfections that might reduce the score:\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: The steps are clearly outlined, but could benefit from a bit more explanation for each transition. For instance, the transition from finding Brittany's phone capacity to setting up the equation involving the number of ducks could be more explicitly explained.\n\n2. **Formatting**: The formatting is adequate, but there could be a more structured presentation of the solution, with each step clearly numbered or labeled to enhance readability.\n\n3. **Verification**: The verification step is present and correct, but it could be expanded to clearly show how each condition of the problem is satisfied, rather than just stating it in a single sentence.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The conclusion is concise and correct, but stating the final answer in a distinct format or box would help to clearly indicate that the calculation is complete and the result is ready.\n\n5. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are minor grammatical and typographical issues that could be addressed, such as \"The answer is 6#### 6\" which is confusing and redundant.\n\nGiven these points, while the solution is mathematically accurate, the presentation and clarity could be improved.\n\n[Score]-20"
