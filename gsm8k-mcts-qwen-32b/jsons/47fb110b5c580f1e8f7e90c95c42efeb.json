The solution could benefit from clearer labeling and segmentation. For instance, it could start with a more formal problem breakdown before diving into calculations.\n2. The verification step is good but can be made clearer by breaking it down into its constituent parts more explicitly.\n3. There is some repetition in the calculation process that could be streamlined for brevity, which might indicate a less efficient problem-solving approach.\n4.

            "[Analyst]The provided answer is entirely inadequate and does not address the question at all. It simply states that the respondent does not know the answer, which is not an acceptable response for a math problem that requires calculation. The respondent should have broken down the problem step-by-step to demonstrate understanding and then provide the correct answer. Failure to do so results in a severe deduction in points. Moreover, no calculations or reasoning were provided to arrive at an answer, which is a critical flaw. The response does not show any effort to solve the problem, which is unacceptable.
