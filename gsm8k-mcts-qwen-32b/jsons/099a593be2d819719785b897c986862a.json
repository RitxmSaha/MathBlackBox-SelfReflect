        "[reasoning process] \nTo solve this, we first recognize that the ages of Darrell and Allen can be described in terms of a common variable. Given their ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x. The sum of their ages is stated as 162, we can write the equation:\n\n7x + 11x = 162\n\nCombining like terms gives:\n\n18x = 162\n\nDividing both sides by 18, we get:\n\nx = 162 / 18\nx = 9\n\nUsing the value of x, we can determine their current ages:\n- Darrell's current age = 7x = 7 * 9 = 63\n- Allen's current age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99\n\nThe question asks for Allen's age 10 years from now, which would be:\n\nAllen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the calculations to ensure they are correct. \n\n- Allen's current age is 99, and Darrell's is 63.

            "[Analyst] The solution provided is mostly accurate and logically sound, but there are a few areas that could be improved to ensure the marks are rigorous and to highlight any minor imperfections:\n\n1. [Incorrect Ratio Interpretation]: The solution correctly identifies the ratio and sets up the equations, but the verification section incorrectly states that the ratio 99:63 simplifies to 11:7, which is the inverse of the correct representation. It should recognize 63:99 simplifies to 7:11, confirming the ratio provided in the problem.\n2. [Clarity in Calculation Steps]: While the steps are correct, the presentation can be more precise and detailed. For example, explicitly stating the solution for \\(x\\) directly after solving the equation would improve clarity.\n3. [Formula Presentation]: The solution could benefit from more consistent notation and presentation of mathematical steps. For instance, the division step could be written more formally: \\(x = \\frac{162}{18}\\).\n4. [Verification Language]: The verification section does a good job checking the total age but could improve by clearly stating each check and its correctness. For example, instead of a single statement, it could break it into two distinct statements: checking the total age and checking the ratio.\n5. [Final Answer Format]: The final answer is correct, but it could be formatted more cleanly to avoid any misinterpretation. It should be boxed or clearly stated as \"Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.\"\n\nGiven these points, the solution is strong but contains a few areas for improvement.
