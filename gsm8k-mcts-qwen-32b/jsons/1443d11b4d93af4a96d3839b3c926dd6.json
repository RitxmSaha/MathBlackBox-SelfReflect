            "[Analyst] The solution provided is mostly correct but can be improved in several ways. Here are the points to consider:\n\n1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: The reasoning process is clear, but it could be more concise and to the point. There's a bit of unnecessary detail that doesn't add significant value to the problem-solving process.\n   \n2. **Formatting and Structure**: While the solution is logically structured, the use of phrases like \"On the first day\" and \"The officer noted\" can be seen as conversational and less formal. A more formal and step-by-step numerical approach would be preferred for a academic or professional setting.\n\n3. **Mathematical Precision**: The calculations are correct, but they could benefit from being introduced in a more straightforward manner, eliminating the need for specific phrasing like \"The officer noted\".\n\n4. **Verification**: The verification part is sound and adds value, but it's not essential in a concise problem-solving context. It may be omitted or shortened.\n\n5. **Final Answer Precision**: The final answer is correct and well-stated, but it would be better to make it more formal, e.g., \"The answer is 4 containers\" instead of just \"The answer is 4\".\n\nGiven these points, the solution is solid but could be improved for greater clarity and conciseness.\n\n[Score] -10"

            "[Analyst] The provided answer does not attempt to solve the problem and simply states that the answer cannot be provided. This response shows a complete lack of effort and understanding of the problem. The Analyst should have taken the information provided, performed the necessary calculations, and arrived at a solution. \n\nTo solve the problem, the analyst should have done the following:\n1. Calculate the initial number of vehicles: 2 containers * 5 vehicles per container = 10 vehicles.\n2. Subtract the initial number from the final total: 30 vehicles total - 10 vehicles initial = 20 vehicles.\n3. Determine the number of new containers by dividing the new total number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container: 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers.\n\nBy not following these steps and not providing any form of attempt or explanation, the answer receives a very low score.
