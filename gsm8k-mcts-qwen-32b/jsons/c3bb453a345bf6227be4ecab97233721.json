        "[reasoning process]\nFirst, let's establish the number of boys at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, there are 2 * 60 boys = 120 boys at the school. The total number of students, therefore, is the sum of the number of girls and boys, which is 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students.\n\nNext, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by the ratio: 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify this, we can reverse the calculation. If there are indeed 36 teachers, and the ratio of students to teacher is 5:1, then there should be 36 * 5 = 180 students, which matches our earlier calculation.

            "[Analyst] While the solution provided is mostly correct, there are a few areas where improvements can be made. First, the answer format could be more precise, explicitly stating \"The number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36.\" The verification step is a good inclusion but could be slightly more detailed. It should specify that the reversal of the calculation confirms the solution, thus making it a more robust check. Also, the answer could be enclosed in a box or formatted more clearly to stand out. Overall, the solution is accurate but lacks the final polish and detail necessary for a perfect score.\n\n[Score]-5"

            "[Analyst] The student's response \"I Don't Know\" demonstrates a lack of attempt to solve the problem. The question provides sufficient information to calculate the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school. Here is the step-by-step process to find the solution:\n\n1. The problem states that there are twice as many boys as girls. Given that there are 60 girls, the number of boys can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys} = 2 \\times 60 = 120\n   \\]\n\n2. The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of students} = 60 + 120 = 180\n   \\]\n\n3. The problem also states that there are 5 students for every teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers can be calculated by dividing the total number of students by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of teachers} = \\frac{180}{5} = 36\n   \\]\n\nSince the student did not provide any calculations or an answer, the response shows a complete failure to engage with the problem. There is no indication of understanding or any attempt to apply the given information to solve the problem. Therefore, the lowest score should be assigned.\n\n[Score]...-100..."
