            "[Analyst] While the reasoning process and the final answer are correct, the solution lacks a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations and could benefit from more explicit verification steps. Additionally, the answer format is slightly off, as it is presented in a way that doesn't clearly separate the response from the original question. Here are some specific issues:\n\n1. The calculations are correct, but they are presented in a rather dense format without clear intermediate steps or explanations for each operation performed.\n2. The verification step is correct, but it could be more detailed and clearly separated from the main reasoning process to ensure clarity.\n3. The final answer could be more explicitly stated and presented in a neat, boxed format or clearly labeled as the final answer.\n\nConsidering these points, I would deduct a small amount of score to reflect areas of improvement while acknowledging the correctness of the solution.\n\n[Score]-5"
