    "ground_truth": "In one day, there are a total of 4 teachers * 2 lessons each = <<4*2=8>>8 lessons.\nThe whiteboard is therefore cleaned 8 lessons * 3 cleans per lesson = <<8*3=24>>24 times.\n#### 24",

        "[Reasoning process] To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to multiply the number of lessons per teacher by the number of teachers, and then multiply that with the number of cleanings per lesson. \n\n1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.\n2. There are 4 teachers using the whiteboard.\n3. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.\n\nFirstly, we calculate the total number of lessons per day: 2 lessons/teacher * 4 teachers = 8 lessons/day.\n\nNextly, we multiply the number of lessons per day by the number of cleanings per lesson to find the total number of cleanings per day: 8 lessons/day * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings/day.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our solution is correct, let's break the calculation down to check it. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and eachlesson requires 3 cleanings of the whiteboard, so each teacher needs 2 * 3 = 6 cleanings per day. Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of cleanings required per day would be 6 cleanings/teacher * 4 teachers = 24 cleanings/day.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24\n#### 24",
