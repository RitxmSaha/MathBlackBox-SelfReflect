The question requires a calculation of the total money raised from selling brownies and cheesecakes, but the given answer simply states a lack of knowledge regarding how to calculate it. There is also no effort shown in attempting to solve the problem or even breaking down the steps that would be necessary to find the solution. Furthermore, the response contains a grammatical error (\"I don't know the answer to this question, sorry.\" is acceptable, but the tone of the answer is weak and unprofessional for an academic or professional context).
