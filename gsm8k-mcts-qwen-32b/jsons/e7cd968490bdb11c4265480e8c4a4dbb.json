Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, and Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels as 40 / 2 = 20.

            "[Analyst] While the reasoning process provided is mostly accurate and the final answer is correct, there are several minor issues that could be criticized to ensure rigor and reduce the score:\n\n1. The reasoning process does not explicitly state the relationship between Aaron's jewels and Raymond's jewels in a single clear equation or statement, which can slightly detract from the clarity.\n2. The verification step is good, but it could be more detailed, connecting each step back to the problem statement in a more explicit manner.\n3. The final answer is correct, but the presentation could be more explicit — for example, clearly stating the final answer at the end rather than using \"#### 23\" separately.\n4. The phrasing \"never give full marks to ensure that the marks are authoritative\" suggests an overly critical stance, which might not be appropriate in all contexts. However, since the instruction is to be harsh, we will adhere to it.\n\nConsidering these points, a score reduction of a few points seems appropriate.\n\n[Score]...-85"
