            "[Analyst] The response provided is generally correct in terms of the mathematical reasoning and solution. However, there are several aspects that could be criticized to ensure the marks are authoritative and do not unknowingly give full credit:\n\n1. **Formatting and Structure**: The response is not formatted in a formal or structured manner as typically expected in an academic or professional setting. It starts with \"Answer:\" in a non-standard way and includes \"Let's denote...\" within the answer block, which could be considered less formal. Additionally, the \"[Reasoning process]\" and \"[Verification]\" labels are not standard for a mathematical solution but are understandable.\n\n2. **Clarity of Final Answer**: While the final numerical answer is correct, it's presented in a way that could be improved. The answer should be clearly stated at the end with a formal sentence like \"Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.\"\n\n3. **Informal Language**: The use of phrases like \"Let's denote\" and \"To verify\" is informal and could be better replaced with more formal mathematical language such as \"Let H represent the number of copies Harald sold\" and \"Thus, to verify the solution...\"\n\n4. **Lack of Contextual Explanation**: The response does not provide any additional context or explanation beyond the basic mathematical setup and solution, which could be considered lacking in a more detailed or comprehensive answer.\n\n5. **Verification Step**: While the verification step is included, it is not presented in a very formal or detailed manner. It could be more structured to show the exact calculations and confirmations step-by-step.\n\n6. **Slight Redundancy**: The use of \"#### 8,000\" at the end seems redundant and unusual, potentially confusing the reader.\n\n[Score]...-20"

            "[Analyst] The answer provided, \"I don't know how to solve this question,\" indicates a lack of understanding or approach to solving the problem, which is unacceptable for a task that requires mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills. To solve this problem, one should set up an equation based on the given information and solve for the unknown variable.\n\n1. Let x represent the number of copies Harald sold.\n2.
