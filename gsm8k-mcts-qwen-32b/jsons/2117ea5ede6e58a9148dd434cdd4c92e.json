        "[Reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many students enrolled in contemporary dance.

            "[Analyst] The reasoning process is generally correct, but there are a few areas where improvements could be made to ensure clarity and precision. Here are the specific issues:\n\n1. **Redundant Verification:** The verification steps in the solution replicate the reasoning process, which is somewhat redundant. This doesn't significantly detract from the correctness of the answer, but it can be streamlined for better flow.\n2. **Formatting and Clarity:** The solution could benefit from clearer labeling and separation of intermediate steps. This would make it easier to follow the logic, especially for those reading quickly.\n3. **Final Answer Formatting:** The final answer could be presented more clearly by explicitly stating the final percentage at the end of the reasoning rather than separately.\n4. **Terminology:** The phrase \"never give full marks to ensure that the marks are authoritative\" seems a bit harsh and unnecessarily critical. It's better to be constructive about feedback.\n\nBased on these points, the score would be:\n\n[Score]...-15...\n\nThis score reflects a high level of correctness with a few minor deductions for clarity and formatting."

The student did not show any work, calculations, or attempt to break down the problem into steps, which is a critical part of solving percentage and arithmetic problems. Additionally, not even an attempt to understand the distribution of students among the different dance genres was made. The answer \"I don't know how to solve this question\" indicates a lack of engagement with the problem and a failure to apply mathematical reasoning or problem-solving strategies that would lead to a solution. This approach is unacceptable in an academic setting where problem-solving skills are essential.
