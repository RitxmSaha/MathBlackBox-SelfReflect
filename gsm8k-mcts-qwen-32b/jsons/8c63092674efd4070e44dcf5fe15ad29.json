        "[Reasoning process]\n1. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as D. Since Sarah does 4 times as much as David, Sarah's laundry amount is 4D.\n2. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Thus, 4D = 400.\n3. Solving for D, we find that David does D = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.\n4. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.\n5. To find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we subtract David's laundry amount from Raymond's: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.\n\n[Verification]\n- Sarah's laundry: 400 pounds\n- David's laundry: 400 / 4 = 100 pounds\n- Raymond's laundry: 400 / 2 = 200 pounds\n- Difference between Raymond and David: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100\n#### 100",

For example, the separation between different steps and calculations could be more distinct to improve readability.\n2. **Units**: While the units (pounds) are provided, it might be clearer to always explicitly state the units for each calculation, even in intermediate steps.\n3. **Verification**: The verification step is good, but it could be more robust by including a brief statement that explains why the verification confirms the solution.\n4. **Final Answer**: The final answer is correct, but it could be more explicitly stated to emphasize that 100 pounds is the final result.\n\nDespite these minor issues, the core calculations and logic are correct.
