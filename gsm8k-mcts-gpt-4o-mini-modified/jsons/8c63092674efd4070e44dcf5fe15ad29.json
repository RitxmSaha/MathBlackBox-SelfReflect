        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's first determine how much laundry Sarah does, which is given as 400 pounds. \n\nAccording to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. To find out how much David does, we set up the following equation:  \nLet \\( D \\) be the amount of laundry David does.  \nThen, \\( S = 4D \\).  \nWe know \\( S = 400 \\) pounds.  \n\nSo, we can write:  \n\\[ 400 = 4D \\]  \nNow, solving for \\( D \\):  \n\\[ D = \\frac{400}{4} = 100 \\text{ pounds} \\]  \n\nNext, we find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Let \\( R \\) be the amount of laundry Raymond does:  \n\\[ R = \\frac{1}{2}S \\]  \nSubstituting for \\( S \\):  \n\\[ R = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 400 = 200 \\text{ pounds} \\]  \n\nNow, we have the amounts of laundry done:  \n- Raymond: 200 pounds  \n- David: 100 pounds  \n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the amounts of laundry Raymond and David do:  \n\\[ \\text{Difference} = R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 \\text{ pounds} \\]  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the individual calculations:  \n- Sarah does 400 pounds, which is stated.  \n- David, doing 4 times less, yields 100 pounds. Calculation: \\( 400 \\div 4 = 100 \\).  \n- Raymond, doing half of Sarah’s laundry, yields 200 pounds. Calculation: \\( 400 \\div 2 = 200 \\).  \n- The difference calculation also holds true: \\( 200 - 100 = 100 \\).  \n\nAll calculations confirm that the logical steps are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100  \n#### 100",
