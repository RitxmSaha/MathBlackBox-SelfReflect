    "ground_truth": "Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000\nCombining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000\nDividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000\n#### 8000",
