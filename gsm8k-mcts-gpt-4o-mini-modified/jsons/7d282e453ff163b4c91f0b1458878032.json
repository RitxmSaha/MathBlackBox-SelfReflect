        "[Reasoning process] Let's start by determining the number of pets in the neighborhood based on the information given:\n\n1. The number of dogs is given as 60.\n2. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cats} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of dogs} = 2 \\times 60 = 120\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we find the total number of dogs and cats combined:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total dogs and cats} = \\text{Number of dogs} + \\text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180\n   \\]\n\n4. According to the problem, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rabbits} = \\text{Total dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168\n   \\]\n\n5. Finally, we calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood (dogs, cats, and rabbits):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pets} = \\text{Number of dogs} + \\text{Number of cats} + \\text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To verify:\n- We have 60 dogs and 120 cats, which correctly sums to 180.\n- The number of rabbits is indeed 168, calculated from 180 - 12.\n- Adding these gives us 348 total pets in the neighborhood.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 348 \\n#### 348",
