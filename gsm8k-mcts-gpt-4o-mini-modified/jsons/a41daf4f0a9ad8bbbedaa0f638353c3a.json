        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of units in the apartment building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can find the total number of units by multiplying these two numbers:\n\nTotal Units = Number of Floors × Units per Floor = 15 × 8 = 120 units.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of these units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. Therefore, we can calculate the number of occupied units:\n\nOccupied Units = Total Units × (3/4) = 120 × (3/4) = 120 × 0.75 = 90 units.\n\nTo find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:\n\nUnoccupied Units = Total Units - Occupied Units = 120 - 90 = 30 units.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations. We initially calculated the total number of units as 120. The occupied units were found to be 90, calculated from 3/4 of the total. Subtracting the occupied from the total indeed gives us 30 unoccupied units. Thus, the calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \\n#### 30",
