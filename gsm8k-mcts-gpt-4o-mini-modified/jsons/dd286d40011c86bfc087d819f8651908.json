    "query": "Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?",
    "ground_truth": "Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants\nTomorrow, Mary’s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.\n#### 58",

        "[reasoning process] \nMary currently has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. To find the total number of plants she currently has on the ledges, we multiply the number of plants per ledge by the number of ledges:\n\nTotal potted plants on ledges = 2 plants/ledge × 40 ledges = 80 plants.\n\nNext, Mary received 18 new potted plants from the nursery. So, we add these new plants to her existing plants:\n\nTotal potted plants now = 80 plants + 18 plants = 98 plants.\n\nTomorrow, Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of her 40 window ledges. Hence, she will give away:\n\nPotted plants given away = 1 plant/ledge × 40 ledges = 40 plants.\n\nTo find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she currently has:\n\nRemaining potted plants = Total potted plants now - Potted plants given away = 98 plants - 40 plants = 58 plants.\n\n[Verification]\nWe double-check that the calculations are correct: \n- Total plants from window ledges: 40 ledges × 2 plants/ledge = 80 plants.\n- Total after receiving new plants: 80 + 18 = 98 plants.\n- Total given away: 40 ledges × 1 plant/ledge = 40 plants.\n- Remaining: 98 - 40 = 58 plants.\n\nAll calculations validate correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 58  \n#### 58",
