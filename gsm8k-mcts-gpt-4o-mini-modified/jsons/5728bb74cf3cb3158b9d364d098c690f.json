    "query": "Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?",
    "ground_truth": "Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.\nHer hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.\nSo, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.\nHer regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.\nThus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.\n#### 460",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine Eliza's regular pay for the first 40 hours she worked. Since her rate is $10 per hour, her earnings for these hours would be:\n\nRegular Pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400\n\nNext, we need to account for the additional 5 hours she worked, which is considered overtime. Eliza's overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate. Therefore, her overtime pay rate is:\n\nOvertime Rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour\n\nNow we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:\n\nOvertime Pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60\n\nNext, we combine her regular earnings and her overtime pay to find her total earnings for the week:\n\nTotal Earnings = Regular Pay + Overtime Pay = $400 + $60 = $460\n\n[Verification] Let's ensure the calculations are correct:\n1. Regular earnings: 40 hours at $10/hour = $400.\n2. Overtime earnings: 5 hours at $12/hour = $60.\n3. Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460.
