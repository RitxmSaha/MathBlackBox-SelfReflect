However, she expects that 1/4 of the attendees will not show up. Therefore, the number of attendees she anticipates can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Expected attendees = Total invited friends × (1 - Probability of showing up)  \n  Expected attendees = 16 × (1 - 1/4)  \n  Expected attendees = 16 × (3/4)  \n  Expected attendees = 12  \n\nSince Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest due to the anticipated absences, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed:\n\n- Total gift bags needed = Expected attendees × Gift bags per guest  \n  Total gift bags needed = 12 × 0.75  \n  Total gift bags needed = 9  \n\nNext, we need to find out how much Christina will spend on these gift bags:\n\n- Cost per gift bag = $2  \n- Total cost = Total gift bags needed × Cost per gift bag  \n  Total cost = 9 × 2  \n  Total cost = $18  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo confirm, we can recheck our calculations:  \n1.

            "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many guests Christina expects to attend her birthday party.

Therefore, the total number of gift bags required is:\n\nNumber of gift bags = Number of expected attendees * Gift bags needed per guest\n= 12 * 0.75\n= 9 gift bags.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous answer step by step and critique it for any potential flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Answer:\n\n1. **Clarity in Problem Breakdown**:\n   - The initial segmentation of the problem is good, as it walks through the steps methodically. However, overly complex wording could confuse a reader. Simplifying language and clearly labeling each calculation step could enhance understanding.\n\n2. **Accuracy of Calculations**:\n   - The calculations for expected attendees and gift bags are correct based on the question's parameters. Each logical step leading to the conclusion of 12 attendees and 9 gift bags is accurate.\n\n3. **Explanation of Logic**:\n   - The reasoning process explains how 1/4 of the invited friends do not show up. However, it could benefit from a clearer connection between the number of friends invited, those who showed up, and the gift bags needed, explicitly stating the relationship rather than jumping into calculations.\n\n4. **Verification Step**:\n   - While the verification step checks the calculations, it could elaborate more on why each calculation is important in the context of the birthday party logistics. It mentions confirming the math but lacks a detailed explanation of implications (e.g., why the number of attendees affects gift bags).\n\n5. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The response effectively uses sections (\"reasoning process,\" \"verification,\" and \"final answer”), yet it may benefit from subheadings or clearer bullet points to enhance readability. This will make it easier for readers to follow each distinct part of the solution.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The \"Final Answer\" section is formatted correctly, but it could provide additional context to remind the reader what the answer represents (total cost of gift bags). Including a complete sentence could reinforce clarity.\n\n7. **Inclusion of Alternative Perspectives**:\n   - Discussing possible scenarios (like if more guests showed up than expected) could make the answer more robust. It would demonstrate thorough consideration of the problem and potential variables in a real-life scenario.\n\n### Summary of Improvements:\n\n- Simplify language and improve clarity in the reasoning process.\n- Elaborate on connections between calculations and real-life implications.\n- Use structured formatting (bullet points or subheadings) to enhance readability.\n- Provide a more descriptive final answer and context surrounding it.\n- Consider including alternative perspectives or scenarios to show thorough analysis.\n\nBy addressing these points, the response can be strengthened, making it more user-friendly while maintaining the accuracy of the calculations.",

Since she invited 16 friends and 1/4 of them are expected not to show up, we calculate the number of attendees as follows:\n\nNumber of expected attendees = Total invited friends - (1/4 * Total invited friends)\n= 16 - (1/4 * 16)\n= 16 - 4\n= 12 attendees.\n\nNext, we calculate how many gift bags Christina needs. She needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. Therefore, the total number of gift bags required is:\n\nNumber of gift bags = Number of expected attendees * Gift bags needed per guest\n= 12 * 0.75\n= 9 gift bags.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the gift bags. Since each gift bag costs $2, the total expense for the gift bags is:\n\nTotal cost = Number of gift bags * Cost per gift bag\n= 9 * $2\n= $18.\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations, we can check each step. We saw that Christina invited 16 friends, and indeed, 1/4 of those not showing up gives us 4 who do not attend, leading to 12 expected attendees. The calculation for gift bags at 0.75 per attendee leads to 9 bags, and checking the cost at $2 per bag gives us a total of $18. All calculations confirm that the math is consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $18 \\n#### $18"
