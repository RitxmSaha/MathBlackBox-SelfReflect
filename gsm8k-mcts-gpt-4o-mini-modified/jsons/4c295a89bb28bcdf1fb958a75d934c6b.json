    "query": "Sophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?",
    "ground_truth": "To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon\nTo find how far Olivia can go on a single tank, multiply 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = <<25*12=300>>300 miles\n#### 300",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we start by finding her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (MPG). She has already traveled 100 miles and used 4 gallons to refill her tank. Therefore, her fuel efficiency can be calculated as follows:\n\nFuel Efficiency (MPG) = Total Miles Traveled / Gallons Used\nFuel Efficiency (MPG) = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 MPG\n\nNext, we need to find out how far she can drive on a full tank of gas. The owner's manual states that her car's gas tank holds 12 gallons. Using her fuel efficiency:\n\nTotal Miles on Full Tank = Fuel Efficiency (MPG) × Tank Capacity (gallons)\nTotal Miles on Full Tank = 25 MPG × 12 gallons = 300 miles\n\nThus, Sophia can drive up to 300 miles on a single tank of gas.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations by rechecking the steps. First, confirming the fuel efficiency:\n\n1. 100 miles were traveled.\n2. 4 gallons of gas were needed to refill the tank.\n3. Fuel Efficiency: 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 MPG.\n\nThis indicates she can drive 25 miles for every gallon. Next, confirm the distance she can drive with a full tank:\n\n1. The tank holds 12 gallons.\n2. Therefore, 25 MPG × 12 gallons = 300 miles.\n\nBoth calculations consistently lead to the same conclusion.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 miles \\n#### 300",
