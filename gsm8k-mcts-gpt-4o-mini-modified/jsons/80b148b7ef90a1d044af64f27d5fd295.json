        "[reasoning process] To determine how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we first need to understand a few key points:\n\n1. The dragon can breathe fire up to a distance of 1000 feet, meaning that Polly must stand outside of this range to avoid being burned.\n2. Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet when not holding the sapphire gemstone.\n3. When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than when she is not holding it.\n\nLet’s calculate how far she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone: \n- The distance she can throw with the gemstone = 3 × 400 feet = 1200 feet.\n\nSince the dragon's flames reach out to 1000 feet, if Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet while holding the gemstone, she can stand at a distance from the dragon where she can still hit it.\n\nNext, we need to find the distance she can stand outside of the dragon's range (1000 feet) while still being able to hit the dragon (1200 feet). To find this safe standing distance:\n\n- Distance she can throw (1200 feet) - Distance dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) = Distance Polly can stand outside of the dragon's flames.\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet.\n\nThis means Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's flame reach and still effectively hit the dragon with her javelin.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure that the answer is correct, let's recap the distances:\n- The dragon's flame reaches 1000 feet. \n- Polly, with the gem, can throw from a range of 1,200 feet.\n- Therefore, she can safely be 200 feet outside the fire zone of 1000 feet to still land the throw successfully.\n\nThus, the calculations hold true: Polly can indeed throw the javelin from a distance that is 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames if she is holding the sapphire gemstone.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 200 feet \\n#### 200 feet",
