        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of raspberries from the clusters. Since there are 6 clusters with 20 fruits each, we can find the total from the clusters by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of fruits per cluster: \n\n6 clusters × 20 fruits/cluster = 120 fruits in clusters.\n\nNext, we need to add the number of individual fruits scattered across the bush. There are 67 individual fruits.\n\nNow, we add the total from the clusters to the individual fruits:\n\n120 fruits (from clusters) + 67 individual fruits = 187 total fruits.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations. We have:\n\n1. Number of fruits from clusters: 6 × 20 = 120.\n2. Number of individual fruits: 67.\n\nNow adding these:\n\n120 + 67 = 187.\n\nThe calculations were confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 187 \\n#### 187",
