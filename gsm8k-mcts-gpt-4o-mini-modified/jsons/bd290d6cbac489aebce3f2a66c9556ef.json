        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber that Sasha purchased. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each, and five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each. \n\n1. Calculate the total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards:\n   - Number of boards = 10\n   - Cost per board = $10\n   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards:\n   - Number of boards = 5\n   - Cost per board = $16\n   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.\n\n3. Find the total cost of all the lumber:\n   - Total cost = $100 (for 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (for 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180.\n\nNext, we need to determine the selling price after the 50% increase in price from when she originally bought the lumber.\n\n4. Calculate the selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards:\n   - Original price per board = $10\n   - Increased price = $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15.\n   - Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.\n\n5. Calculate the selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards:\n   - Original price per board = $16\n   - Increased price = $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24.\n   - Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.\n\n6. Find the total selling price of all the lumber:\n   - Total selling price = $150 (for 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (for 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270.\n\nNow, we can calculate the profit made by selling the lumber.\n\n7. Calculate profit:\n   - Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.\n\n[Verification] Each step of the calculation has been carefully made to ensure accuracy.
