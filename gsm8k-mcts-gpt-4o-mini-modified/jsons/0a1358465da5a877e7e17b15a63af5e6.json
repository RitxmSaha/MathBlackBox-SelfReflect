        "[reasoning process] Let's define the ages of each child based on the information given. We know that:\n\n1. James is 10 years old.\n2. James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.\n3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.\n4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.\n\nNow we have calculated the ages:\n- James = 10\n- Corey = 11\n- Amy = 9\n- Jackson = 4\n\nTo confirm our findings:\n- James is indeed 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, who is 11.\n- Amy is 9 years old, which is 2 years younger than Corey.\n- Jackson is 4 years old, which is 5 years younger than Amy.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Verification] We derived Jackson's age based on the relationships between their ages and confirmed that James is younger than Corey, Amy's age is correctly placed between Jackson and Corey, and Jackson's age fits the comparison to Amy's.
