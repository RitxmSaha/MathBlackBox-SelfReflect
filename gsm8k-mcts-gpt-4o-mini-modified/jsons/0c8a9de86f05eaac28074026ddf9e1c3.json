        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we first need to identify how many bolts of each type of fiber are required. The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much of white fiber. Since half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt, the robe will require 1 bolt of white fiber. Next, we sum the bolts of both colors: 2 bolts of blue fiber plus 1 bolt of white fiber, which equals a total of 3 bolts. \n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations. We have:\n- Blue fiber: 2 bolts\n- White fiber: 0.5 * 2 = 1 bolt\n\nNow, adding these amounts together:\n2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts in total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
