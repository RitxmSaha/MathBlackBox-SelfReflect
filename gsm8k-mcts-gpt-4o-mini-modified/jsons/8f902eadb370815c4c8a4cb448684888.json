        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find Charlie's net profit from selling 20 beeswax candles, we need to break down the costs and revenues. \n\n1. **Candle Production**:  \n   - Each pound of beeswax produces 10 candles.\n   - To make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (since 20 candles ÷ 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds).\n\n2. **Cost of Supplies**:  \n   - The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.\n   - Therefore, for 2 pounds, the total cost is:  \n     \\[\n     2 \\, \\text{pounds} \\times 10 \\, \\text{dollars per pound} = 20 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Revenue from Selling Candles**:  \n   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.\n   - If he sells 20 candles, his total revenue will be:  \n     \\[\n     20 \\, \\text{candles} \\times 2 \\, \\text{dollars per candle} = 40 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Net Profit Calculation**:  \n   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Costs} = 40 \\, \\text{dollars} - 20 \\, \\text{dollars} = 20 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nNow, let's verify the calculations.
