        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining the number of each type of gem in the treasure chest. We know the following:\n\n1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.\n2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Therefore, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140\n   \\]\n3. **Emeralds**: The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. Therefore, we calculate the number of emeralds as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Emeralds} = 2 \\times 140 = 280\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of gems in the chest by adding up the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:\n\\[\n\\text{Total gems} = \\text{Diamonds} + \\text{Rubies} + \\text{Emeralds} = 175 + 140 + 280\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Total gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure that our calculations are accurate:\n- Starting with the diamonds, we have 175, which is correct.\n- For the rubies, we calculated 175 - 35 = 140, which matches our findings.\n- For the emeralds, twice the number of rubies gives us 2 * 140 = 280, which is also correct.\n- Adding these figures up: 175 + 140 + 280 indeed sums to 595.\n\nSince all our calculations align and have been verified, we can confidently state:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 595 \\n#### 595",
