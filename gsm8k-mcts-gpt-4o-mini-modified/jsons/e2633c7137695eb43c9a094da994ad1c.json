        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much volume of canned tomatoes Freda started with to end up with 32 ounces of sauce. Since the canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, we can conclude that the volume of canned tomatoes used must have been double that of the final sauce produced. \n\nThus, if Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, the initial volume of canned tomatoes she used would be:\n32 ounces (sauce) x 2 (because the volume is halved) = 64 ounces of canned tomatoes.\n\nNext, we need to know how many cans of tomatoes are required to get 64 ounces. Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, so the number of cans Freda used is calculated as follows:\n64 ounces ÷ 16 ounces per can = 4 cans of tomatoes.\n\nSince each can contains three tomatoes, we can now find the total number of tomatoes:\n4 cans x 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.\n\n[Verification] \nWe started with 64 ounces of canned tomatoes, which indeed translates to 32 ounces of sauce after cooking. Using 4 cans of tomatoes (each 16 ounces) confirms that Freda used a total of 12 tomatoes (4 cans x 3 tomatoes per can).
