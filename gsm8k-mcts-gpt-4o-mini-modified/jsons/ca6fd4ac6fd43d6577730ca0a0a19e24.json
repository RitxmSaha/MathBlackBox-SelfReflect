        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate how many DVDs the first three customers bought. Each of them buys one DVD, so:\n\n- 1st customer: 1 DVD\n- 2nd customer: 1 DVD\n- 3rd customer: 1 DVD\n\nTotal from the first three customers = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 DVDs.\n\nNext, we calculate how many DVDs the next two customers bought. Each of these customers buys two DVDs, so:\n\n- 4th customer: 2 DVDs\n- 5th customer: 2 DVDs\n\nTotal from the next two customers = 2 + 2 = 4 DVDs.\n\nThe last three customers did not buy any DVDs, which means their contribution to sales is 0 DVDs. \n\nNow, let's sum all the DVDs sold:\n\nTotal DVDs sold = DVDs sold by the first three customers + DVDs sold by the next two customers + DVDs sold by the last three customers\nTotal DVDs sold = 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure the calculations are correct:\n1. First three customers: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 DVDs.\n2. Next two customers: 2 + 2 = 4 DVDs.\n3.
