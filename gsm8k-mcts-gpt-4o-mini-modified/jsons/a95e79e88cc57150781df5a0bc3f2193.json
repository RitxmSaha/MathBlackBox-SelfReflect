        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate how many classes Judy teaches in total during the week. She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday) and 8 classes on Saturday. \n\nThe total number of weekday classes can be calculated as:\n5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes. \n\nAdding the Saturday classes, we have:\n25 classes (weekdays) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes total per week. \n\nNext, we determine the total number of students for the week. Each class has 15 students, so:\n33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students per week.\n\nNow, we calculate her total earnings.
