        "[reasoning process] To determine how much money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes, we start by calculating the total revenue from each type of item he sold. \n\nFirst, we calculate the revenue from the brownies:\n- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 each.\n- Total revenue from brownies = 43 brownies * $3/brownie = 129 dollars.\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from the cheesecakes:\n- Tommy sells 23 cheesecakes at $4 each.\n- Total revenue from cheesecakes = 23 cheesecakes * $4/cheesecake = 92 dollars.\n\nNow, we need to find the total amount of money raised by adding the revenue from both items:\n- Total money raised = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes\n- Total money raised = 129 dollars + 92 dollars = 221 dollars.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by ensuring that the calculations for each item were done correctly. \n1.
