        "[reasoning process] To determine how many grams of chips I can eat, we first need to figure out how many calories are left in my daily allowance. My daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and I've already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories I can consume are:\n\n2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.\n\nNext, we know that a single serving of chips contains 250 calories. Since the bag has 5 servings, the total calorie content for the entire bag is:\n\n250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories for the whole bag.\n\nNow, to find out how many servings I can consume for my remaining 200 calories, we calculate:\n\n200 calories remaining / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.\n\nThis means I can eat 0.8 servings of chips. \n\nNext, we need to convert servings into grams. Since the bag contains 300 grams and has 5 servings, the weight of one serving is:\n\n300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams per serving.\n\nNow we can find out how many grams correspond to 0.8 servings:\n\n0.8 servings * 60 grams/serving = 48 grams.\n\n[Verification] So, I can eat 48 grams of chips with the remaining 200 calories while staying within my target of 2000 calories for the day.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 grams \\n#### 48",
