        "[reasoning process] To find out how much Cynthia spends on ice cream after 60 days, we need to determine how many servings she consumes and then calculate how many cartons she needs to buy. \n\n1. **Daily Ice Cream Consumption**: Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, over 60 days, she will consume:\n   \\[\n   1 \\, \\text{serving/day} \\times 60 \\, \\text{days} = 60 \\, \\text{servings}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cartons Required**: Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60 \\, \\text{servings}}{15 \\, \\text{servings/carton}} = 4 \\, \\text{cartons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Cost**: Each carton costs $4.00. To find the total cost after buying 4 cartons, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:\n   \\[\n   4 \\, \\text{cartons} \\times 4.00 \\, \\text{dollars/carton} = 16.00 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculation step-by-step:\n- **Servings**: 1 serving per day for 60 days is indeed 60 servings. \n- **Cartons needed**: 60 servings divided by 15 servings per carton gives 4 cartons, which is correct.\n- **Total cost**: 4 cartons at $4.00 each does yield a total of $16.00.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16.00 \\n#### 16.00",
