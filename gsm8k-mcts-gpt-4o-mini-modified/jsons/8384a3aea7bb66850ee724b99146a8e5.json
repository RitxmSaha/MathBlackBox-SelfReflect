        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the cost of the boots as \\( B \\). According to the problem, two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, which gives us the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of high heels} = B - 5\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that one pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice that. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of second pair of heels} = 2 \\times 33 = 66\n\\]\n\nNow we can find the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of high heels} = 33 + 66 = 99\n\\]\n\nNext, we can set this equal to our earlier expression for the cost of the high heels:\n\n\\[\n99 = B - 5\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( B \\), we can add 5 to both sides:\n\n\\[\nB = 99 + 5\n\\]\n\\[\nB = 104\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the boots is $104.\n\n[Verification] We need to double-check if everything fits our conditions.
