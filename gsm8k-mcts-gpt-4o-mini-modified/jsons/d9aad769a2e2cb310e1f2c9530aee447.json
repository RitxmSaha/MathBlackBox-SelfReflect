Some of the cars drive through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. 5 cars from the line take an exit so they don't have to drive through the traffic jam.

    "ground_truth": "The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.\nMost of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] Let's analyze the situation step by step. We know that initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. During a 30-minute period, there are two segments of time mentioned: the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes. In the first 15 minutes, we need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam. After that, 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars from the total take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam at all.\n\n1. Start with the original number of cars: 30.\n2. Let \\( x \\) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.\n3. During the second 15 minutes, 20 cars drive through. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam would be \\( x + 20 \\).\n4. Out of the original 30 cars, 5 took an exit, which means the remaining cars that possibly could drive through the traffic jam would be \\( 30 - 5 = 25 \\).\n\nThis means we can set up the equation:\n\\[ x + 20 = 25 \\]\n\n5. Solving this equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x + 20 = 25 \\]\n\\[ x = 25 - 20 \\]\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nThus, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we calculated that 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, and then 20 cars drove through in the second 15 minutes, totaling \\( 5 + 20 = 25 \\). Since 5 cars took the exit, the total remaining cars who stayed in the traffic jam was indeed 25. Our calculations are consistent with the scenario given.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
