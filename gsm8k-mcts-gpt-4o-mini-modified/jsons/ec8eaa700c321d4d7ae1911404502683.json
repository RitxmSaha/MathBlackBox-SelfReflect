        "[reasoning process] To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the first day traveling westward and the second day traveling northward.\n\n1. On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. \n   - Since both trains travel the same distance, each train covers 80 miles on the first day.\n\n2. On the second day, both trains then travel northwards for 150 miles.\n   - Again, since both trains travel the same distance, each train covers 150 miles on the second day.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total distance each train travels over the two days:\n- Total distance for each train = distance traveled on the first day + distance traveled on the second day\n- Total distance for each train = 80 miles (west) + 150 miles (north)\n\n3. Adding these distances gives:\n   - Total distance for each train = 80 + 150 = 230 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance covered by each train over the two days is 230 miles.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the distances step by step: first the distance on day one (80 miles), followed by day two (150 miles). Adding these gives us 230 miles for each train. All calculations confirm that each train indeed travels 80 miles west and 150 miles north, totaling 230 miles. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 230 miles \\n#### 230 miles",
