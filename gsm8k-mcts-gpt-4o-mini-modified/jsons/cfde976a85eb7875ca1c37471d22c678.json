        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of thorns Dan has from his rose bushes, we need to first calculate the total number of roses. Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each bush has 25 roses. Therefore, the total number of roses is:\n\nTotal roses = Number of rose bushes × Roses per bush\nTotal roses = 3 × 25 = 75 roses\n\nNext, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:\n\nTotal thorns = Total roses × Thorns per rose\nTotal thorns = 75 × 8 = 600 thorns\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct, we can break it down again:\n1. Calculate the total number of roses: 3 rose bushes × 25 roses = 75 roses.\n2. Then, for thorns: 75 roses × 8 thorns = 600 thorns.\nBoth calculations confirm the results are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 600 \\n#### 600",
