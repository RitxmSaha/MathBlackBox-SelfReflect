        "[reasoning process] \nTo solve this problem, we first determine the duration of Tom's outward journey from 1 PM to 4 PM. This gives him a total of 3 hours of travel time in the outward direction. \n\nNext, we calculate the distance he traveled during this time. Since his ship travels at 10 miles per hour, the distance traveled can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Distance} = 10 \\text{ mph} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ miles} \n\\]\n\nNow we need to find out how long it takes him to return back to his starting point at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We again utilize the distance and speed relationship. The time taken to travel back can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \n\\]\n\nIn this case:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Time} = \\frac{30 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ mph}} = 5 \\text{ hours} \n\\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, let’s look at the entire trip. Tom sails out for 3 hours at 10 mph covering 30 miles. On the return trip, he covers the same 30 miles, but at a slower speed of 6 mph. The calculation for the return time confirms that it takes 5 hours, which is coherent with the relationship of distance, speed, and time.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours \\n#### 5",
