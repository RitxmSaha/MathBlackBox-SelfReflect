        "[reasoning process] \nLet's start by determining how many boys are at Dr. Wertz's school. We know there are 60 girls and that there are twice as many boys as there are girls. Therefore, the number of boys can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of boys = 2 × Number of girls\nNumber of boys = 2 × 60 = 120 boys\n\nNext, we find the total number of students in the school, which includes both boys and girls. This can be calculated as:\n\nTotal number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys\nTotal number of students = 60 + 120 = 180 students\n\nSince there are 5 students for every teacher, we can determine how many teachers there are by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:\n\nNumber of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher\nNumber of teachers = 180 / 5 = 36 teachers\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure the accuracy of our calculations, we can verify each step:\n\n1. The number of boys is correctly calculated as 120 (twice the number of girls).\n2. The total number of students is accurately summed to be 180.\n3. Finally, dividing the total students (180) by the ratio of students per teacher (5) gives us 36, confirming our count of teachers.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
