    "query": "Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them?",
    "ground_truth": "The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.\nIf every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.\nSo for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.\nAnd for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.\n#### 64",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the cost Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses where the first glass costs $5 and every second glass costs only 60% of the price, we need to break down the purchases into pairs.  \n\nThe regular price of the first glass is $5.  \nThe price of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is calculated as follows:  \n60% of $5 = 0.6 * 5 = $3.  \n\nKylar can be seen purchasing glasses in pairs (1st glass and 2nd glass), and these pairs repeat for the total of 16 glasses. \n\n1.
