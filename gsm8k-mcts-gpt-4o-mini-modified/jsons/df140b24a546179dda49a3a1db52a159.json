        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the given data regarding the oranges in the basket:\n\n1. **Total Oranges**: There are 25 oranges.\n   \n2. **Bad Oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.\n\n3. **Unripe Oranges**: 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate:\n   - 20% of 25 = 0.20 × 25 = 5 unripe oranges.\n\n4. **Sour Oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.\n\n5. **Good Oranges**: To find the number of good oranges, we first calculate the total number of oranges that are not good. This includes the bad, unripe, and sour oranges:\n   - Bad: 1\n   - Unripe: 5\n   - Sour: 2\n   \n   Total not good = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges.\n\n6. Now, we subtract the total not good oranges from the total number of oranges to find the good oranges:\n   - Good = Total - Not Good = 25 - 8 = 17 good oranges.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we will verify each step: \n- The number of unripe oranges calculated as 20% of 25 equals 5. \n- Counting the bad, unripe, and sour oranges gives 1 + 5 + 2 = 8, which confirms that there are 8 oranges that are not good.\n- Lastly, subtracting this from the total number of oranges confirms that there are indeed 17 good oranges.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 17 \\n#### 17",
