        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many flowers Ryan plants in total over the 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers a day, we can calculate the total number of flowers planted by multiplying the number of flowers he plants per day by the number of days:  \n\\[  \n2 \\text{ flowers/day} \\times 15 \\text{ days} = 30 \\text{ flowers}  \n\\]  \n\nNext, we account for the fact that 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the actual number of flowers that grew, we subtract the count of the non-growing flowers from the total number planted:  \n\\[  \n30 \\text{ flowers} - 5 \\text{ flowers (not grown)} = 25 \\text{ flowers (that grew)}  \n\\]  \n\n[Verification]  \nWe started with what Ryan planted and confirmed that he planted 30 flowers in 15 days.
