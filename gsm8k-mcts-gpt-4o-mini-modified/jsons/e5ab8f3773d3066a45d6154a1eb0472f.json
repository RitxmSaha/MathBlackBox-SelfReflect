        "[Reasoning process]  \nWe know that the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. \n\nLet's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy uses as \\( S \\) and the number of cups of water as \\( W \\). According to the ratio, we can write:\n- \\( S = 7x \\)\n- \\( W = 13x \\)\n\nwhere \\( x \\) is the common multiplier. The problem states that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 120. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ S + W = 120 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( S \\) and \\( W \\):\n\\[ 7x + 13x = 120 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 20x = 120 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{120}{20} = 6 \\]\n\nNow, substituting back to find \\( S \\):\n\\[ S = 7x = 7 \\times 6 = 42 \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify the solution, let's calculate \\( W \\) as well:\n\\[ W = 13x = 13 \\times 6 = 78 \\]\n\nNow, adding \\( S \\) and \\( W \\) together to ensure they total 120:\n\\[ S + W = 42 + 78 = 120 \\]\n\nThis confirms our calculations as correct since the total is indeed 120.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 42 \\n#### 42",
