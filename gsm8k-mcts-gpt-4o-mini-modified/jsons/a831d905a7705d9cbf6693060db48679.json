On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes;  At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.  If she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?",
    "ground_truth": "Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.\nThen, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.\nAnd if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23\nSubtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.\n#### 163",

        "[reasoning process] \nLet's first determine how many Post-it notes Candice had before placing any on the coffee cups.
