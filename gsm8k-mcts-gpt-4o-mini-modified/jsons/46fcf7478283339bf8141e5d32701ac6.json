The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \\( B \\) and the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \\( D \\).
