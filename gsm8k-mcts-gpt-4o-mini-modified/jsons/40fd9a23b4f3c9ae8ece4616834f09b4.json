        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total cost Josh incurred in purchasing and repairing the house. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent an additional $50,000 on repairs.

The value increased by 150%, so we calculate the increase as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in Value} = \\text{Original Value} \\times \\text{Percentage Increase} = 80,000 \\times 1.5 = 120,000\n\\]\n\nNow, we add this increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Value of the House} = \\text{Original Value} + \\text{Increase in Value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate Josh's profit by subtracting his total costs from the new value of the house:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{New Value of the House} - \\text{Total Cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total cost as $130,000 and the new value of the house as $200,000.
