        "[reasoning process] Kelian has one recipe with 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first recipe. This means we need to calculate the number of instructions for the second recipe. Since the first recipe has 20 instructions, the second recipe will have 20 * 2 = 40 instructions. To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare both dishes, we add the instructions from both recipes: 20 (first recipe) + 40 (second recipe) = 60 instructions.\n\n[Verification] \n1.
