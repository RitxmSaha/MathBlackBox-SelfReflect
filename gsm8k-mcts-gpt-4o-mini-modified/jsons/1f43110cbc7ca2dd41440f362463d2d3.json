        "[reasoning process] First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are measured in inches. We know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. Therefore, a 4-foot piece of wire is:\n\n4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.\n\nNext, we will determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the 48-inch wire. To find out how many pieces can be cut, we will divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:\n\n48 inches ÷ 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.\n\n[Verification] To ensure this calculation is accurate, we can check by multiplying the number of pieces by the length of each piece to see if it equals the total length of wire:\n\n8 pieces * 6 inches/piece = 48 inches.\n\nSince the total matches the original length of the wire, it confirms our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
