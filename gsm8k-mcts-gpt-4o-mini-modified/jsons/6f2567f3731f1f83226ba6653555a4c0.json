        "[reasoning process] Aleena pays $140 per month for the streaming service. For the first half of the year (which has 6 months), she will pay the full price. Therefore, we calculate the total for the first half as follows:\n\nFirst half total = Monthly charge × Number of months\nFirst half total = $140 × 6 = $840\n\nFor the second half of the year, the streaming company charges her 10% less. We first calculate 10% of her monthly charge:\n\n10% of $140 = 0.10 × $140 = $14\n\nNow, we subtract this amount from her original charge to find the new monthly charge:\n\nNew monthly charge = $140 - $14 = $126\n\nThen, we compute the total for the second half (the remaining 6 months):\n\nSecond half total = New monthly charge × Number of months\nSecond half total = $126 × 6 = $756\n\nNow, we can find the total amount Aleena has paid for the entire year by adding the totals for both halves:\n\nTotal payment = First half total + Second half total\nTotal payment = $840 + $756 = $1596\n\n[Verification] We recheck each computation step. The first half of the year is indeed $840, and the second half is calculated as $126 per month for 6 months, leading to $756. Adding these two gives us $1596, confirming that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1596 \\n#### 1596",
