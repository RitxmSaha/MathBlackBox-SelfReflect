    "ground_truth": "30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5\nHe needs to remove 7.5 more pounds because 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5\nHe needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we determine how much weight Uriah will reduce by removing 30 comic books. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight removed from the comic books is:\n\nWeight removed from comic books = 30 comic books × 1/4 pound/comic book = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNext, we now calculate how much more weight Uriah needs to remove after taking out the comic books. He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds:\n\nRemaining weight to remove = 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up this remaining weight. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the number of toys he needs to remove is calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of toys to remove = Remaining weight to remove / Weight of each toy = 7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 × 2 = 15 toys.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we check if removing 15 toys will amount to the required weight removal. The weight of 15 toys is:\n\nWeight of 15 toys = 15 toys × 1/2 pound/toy = 7.5 pounds.\n\nAdding the previously calculated weight removed from the comic books (7.5 pounds) gives:\n\nTotal weight removed = 7.5 pounds + 7.5 pounds = 15 pounds, which confirms that Uriah will successfully remove the total weight he needs.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15  \n#### 15",
