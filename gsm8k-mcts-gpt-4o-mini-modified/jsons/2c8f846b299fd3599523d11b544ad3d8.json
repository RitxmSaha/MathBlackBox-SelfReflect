He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?",
    "ground_truth": "Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.\nTo feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 pounds of potato salad.\nTo feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.\nIn total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.\n#### 225",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much potato salad is needed for the adults. Since there are 20 adults and each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad, we multiply the number of adults by the amount each adult eats:\n\n20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs of potato salad for adults.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the amount needed for the children. There are 5 children, and each child eats half the amount of an adult, which is 5 pounds:\n\n5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs of potato salad for children.\n\nNow, we add the total amounts needed for adults and children together to find out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring:\n\n200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children) = 225 lbs of potato salad needed for the picnic.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations. For the adults: \n20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs. Correct. \nFor the children: \n5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs. Correct. \nAdding both amounts gives:\n200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs. Correct.\n\nAll calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 225 \\n#### 225",
