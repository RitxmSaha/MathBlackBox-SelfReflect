        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones baked. Since she made 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces:\n\nTotal pieces = Number of pies × Pieces per pie\nTotal pieces = 5 × 8 = 40 pieces.\n\nNext, we know that after the guests served themselves, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:\n\nPieces taken = Total pieces - Remaining pieces\nPieces taken = 40 - 14 = 26 pieces.\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculation, we can check both the total pieces and the subtraction. From the information provided, we confirmed that the total number of pieces baked was 40, and subtracting the remaining 14 pieces indeed yields 26 pieces taken. \n\nThus, the calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 26 pieces taken by the guests. \\n#### 26",
