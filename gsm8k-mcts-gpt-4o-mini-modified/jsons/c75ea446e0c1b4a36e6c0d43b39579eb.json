        "[reasoning process] To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount. The original grooming cost is $100. The groomer offers a 30% discount, so we can calculate the discount amount by multiplying the original cost by the discount percentage:\n\nDiscount Amount = Original Cost × Discount Percentage  \n= $100 × 0.30  \n= $30.\n\nNext, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost after the discount:\n\nFinal Cost = Original Cost - Discount Amount  \n= $100 - $30  \n= $70.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by checking both the discount and final cost. The discount calculated was $30, which is indeed 30% of $100. Thus, subtracting this from $100 gives us $70, confirming that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $70  \n#### $70",
