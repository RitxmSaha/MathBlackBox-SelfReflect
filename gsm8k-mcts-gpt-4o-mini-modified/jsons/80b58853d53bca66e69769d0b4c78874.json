        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start with identifying how many cookies Amir eats. According to the problem, Amir eats 5 cookies. Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3:  \n\\[ \nCody's \\, cookies = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \n\\]  \nNow, we know that Cody eats 15 cookies and Amir eats 5 cookies. To find the total number of cookies both of them eat together, we add the number of cookies each person eats:  \n\\[ \nTotal \\, cookies = Amir's \\, cookies + Cody's \\, cookies = 5 + 15 = 20 \n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure our calculations are correct:  \n- Amir eats 5 cookies, and we confirmed Cody eats 3 times that amount, which gives us 15 cookies.  \n- Adding these together: \\( 5 + 15 = 20 \\).  \n\nAll calculations are verified and consistent with the problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20  \n#### 20",
