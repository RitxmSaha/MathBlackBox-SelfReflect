        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we calculate how many students are enrolled in contemporary dance. Since there are 20 students in total and 20% are enrolled in contemporary dance:\n\nNumber of contemporary dance students = 20% of 20 \n= 0.20 * 20 \n= 4 students.\n\nNext, we find out how many students remain after accounting for those enrolled in contemporary dance:\n\nRemaining students = Total students - Contemporary dance students \n= 20 - 4 \n= 16 students.\n\nNow, we determine how many of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. We know that 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:\n\nNumber of jazz dance students = 25% of 16 \n= 0.25 * 16 \n= 4 students.\n\nNext, we find out how many students are now left who did not enroll in either contemporary or jazz dance:\n\nRemaining students for hip-hop = Remaining students - Jazz dance students \n= 16 - 4 \n= 12 students.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of students who are enrolled in hip-hop dance out of the entire class of 20 students:\n\nPercentage of hip-hop dance students = (Number of hip-hop dance students / Total students) * 100 \n= (12 / 20) * 100 \n= 60%.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can summarize:\n1. 20% of 20 students = 4 in contemporary dance.\n2.
