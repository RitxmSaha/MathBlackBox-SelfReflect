    "ground_truth": "Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nFour apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.\nThe total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.\nThus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.\nTherefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.\n#### 2",
