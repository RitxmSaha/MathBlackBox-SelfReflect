        "[reasoning process] To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we first need to determine Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. \n\nLet's calculate Alex's weight:\n1. First, compute 4 times Grace's weight:  \n   \\( 4 \\times 125 = 500 \\) pounds.\n2. Now, subtract 2 pounds from this result for Alex's weight:  \n   \\( 500 - 2 = 498 \\) pounds.\n\nNow that we know both weights, we can find the combined weight:\n1. Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight:  \n   \\( 125 + 498 = 623 \\) pounds.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations:\n- Grace's weight is confirmed as 125 pounds. \n- Alex's weight calculation:\n   - \\( 4 \\times 125 = 500 \\)\n   - \\( 500 - 2 = 498 \\)\nBoth calculations are correct, confirming that Alex weighs 498 pounds. \n\nNow calculating their combined weight again:  \n\\( 125 + 498 = 623 \\) pounds.
