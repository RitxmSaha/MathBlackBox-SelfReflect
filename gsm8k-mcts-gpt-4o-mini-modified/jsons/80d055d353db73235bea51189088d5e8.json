        "[reasoning process] Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. In one week, there are 7 days, so we need to calculate the number of eggs she consumes in one week. Multiplying the number of eggs per omelet (3) by the number of days in a week (7), we get:\n\n3 eggs/omelet * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many eggs she consumes in 4 weeks. We do this by multiplying the number of eggs she eats in a week (21) by 4 weeks:\n\n21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.\n\nNow, to find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen):\n\n84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.\n\n[Verification] We started with the number of eggs per day (3) and confirmed the weekly total (21) by checking the multiplication. Then we calculated for 4 weeks, ensuring to multiply correctly. Finally, we divided by 12 to verify that our conversion to dozens was correct. \n\nAll calculations have been checked and verified correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7",
