        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of teachers**: There are 4 teachers.\n2. **Identify the number of lessons per teacher**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.\n3. **Calculate the total number of lessons in a day**: Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of lessons per day is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ teachers} \\times 2 \\text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \\text{ lessons}\n   \\]\n4. **Determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.\n5. **Calculate the total number of cleanings in a day**: The total cleanings is given by:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ lessons} \\times 3 \\text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \\text{ cleanings}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the calculations:\n\n- 4 teachers each with 2 lessons gives us \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) lessons in total.
