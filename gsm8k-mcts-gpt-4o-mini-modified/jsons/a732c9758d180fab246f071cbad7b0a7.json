        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch that Janet incurs before insurance. She pays $500 for materials and $800 for the jeweler's construction. We add these two costs together:\n\nCost of materials + Cost of jeweler = $500 + $800 = $1300\n\nNext, Janet pays 10% of this total cost for insurance. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:\n\n0.10 * $1300 = $130\n\nNow, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance to find the complete total amount Janet spends:\n\nTotal cost before insurance + Insurance cost = $1300 + $130 = $1430\n\n[Verification] Let's check the calculations step by step. The total of materials and construction is $500 + $800 = $1300. The insurance, which is 10% of $1300, is calculated as $130. So, the overall total is $1300 + $130 = $1430, confirming that all calculations align correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1430 \\n#### 1430",
