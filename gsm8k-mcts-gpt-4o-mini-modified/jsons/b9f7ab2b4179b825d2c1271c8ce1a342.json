        "[reasoning process] To find the original price of the book, we start with the information that Kyle purchased the book for $19.50 after receiving a 25% discount. We can denote the original price as \\( P \\). The discount means that Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%). Therefore, we can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\n\\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \\]\n\nTo find the original price \\( P \\), we can rearrange this equation:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{19.50}{0.75} \\]\n\nNext, we perform the calculation:\n\n\\[ P = 19.50 \\div 0.75 = 26.00 \\]\n\nSo the original price of the book was $26.00.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check if a 25% discount on the original price gives us the purchase price of $19.50.
