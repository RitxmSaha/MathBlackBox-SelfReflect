Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. He is now 34. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?",
    "ground_truth": "Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.\nHe goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.\nGene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.\n#### 44",

        "[Reasoning Process] First, we need to determine how many years Gene has been vacationing. He began his vacations at 23 years old and is now 34. The difference in age is 34 - 23 = 11 years. \n\nSince he goes on 4 vacations each year, we can find the total number of vacations by multiplying the number of years by the number of vacations per year. This gives us: \n\n11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.\n\nSince each vacation corresponds to one quilt block, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks.\n\n[Verification] It’s essential to verify our calculations. We calculated that he went on vacations for a span of 11 years, each year with 4 vacations, leading to:\n\n11 * 4 = 44.\n\nThere are no errors in our arithmetic or reasoning. Gene indeed has 44 different quilt blocks from his vacations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 44 \\n#### 44",
