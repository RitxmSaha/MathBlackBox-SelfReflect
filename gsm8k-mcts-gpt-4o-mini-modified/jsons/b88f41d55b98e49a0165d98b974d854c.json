It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?",
    "ground_truth": "It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.\nThus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.\nIn those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.\nThus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.\n#### 16",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Julia's rowing speed:**\n   Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find her speed in feet per second, we divide the distance by the time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{20 \\text{ feet}}{16 \\text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \\text{ feet per second}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total distance to shore:**\n   Since the shore is 64 seconds away, we can find the total distance to shore by multiplying her speed by the time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Distance} = 1.25 \\text{ feet/second} \\times 64 \\text{ seconds} = 80 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how much water was taken on during the row:**\n   The problem states that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. First, we can find out how many 10-foot increments are in the total distance:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 10-foot increments} = \\frac{80 \\text{ feet}}{10 \\text{ feet}} = 8\n   \\]\n\n   Since the boat takes on 2 liters for each 10-foot segment, we multiply the number of increments by 2 liters:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Water Taken On} = 8 \\times 2 \\text{ liters} = 16 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We've calculated the rowing speed, determined the total distance to the shore, and multiplied the total 10-foot segments by the amount of water taken on per segment. All calculations are consistent with the information given in the problem, leading us to the conclusion that Julia’s boat took on 16 liters of water by the time she reached shore.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 liters \\n#### 16 liters",
