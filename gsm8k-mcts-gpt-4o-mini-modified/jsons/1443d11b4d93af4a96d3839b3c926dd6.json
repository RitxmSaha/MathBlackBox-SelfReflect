        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine the total number of vehicles present after the first day. We know that each of the 2 containers has 5 vehicles. Thus, the total number of vehicles after the first day can be calculated as:\n\nTotal vehicles after the first day = Number of containers * Vehicles per container\n= 2 * 5 \n= 10 vehicles.\n\nOn the second day, the total number of vehicles was reported to be 30. To find out how many additional vehicles were imported on the second day, we subtract the vehicles from the first day from the total vehicles:\n\nAdditional vehicles = Total vehicles - Vehicles after first day\n= 30 - 10 \n= 20 vehicles.\n\nNext, since all the new containers also contain 5 vehicles each, we can determine the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the additional number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container:\n\nNumber of additional containers = Additional vehicles / Vehicles per container\n= 20 / 5 \n= 4 containers.\n\n[Verification] \nWe began with 10 vehicles from the first day and added an additional 20 vehicles from 4 new containers.
