        "[reasoning process] To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the outer dimensions are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches and the walls are 1 inch thick, we can calculate the inner dimensions by subtracting twice the thickness of the walls from each outer dimension.\n\n1. The inner length is calculated as follows:\n   - Outer length = 5 inches\n   - Thickness of walls = 1 inch (1 inch on each side, so we subtract 2 inches)\n   - Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches\n\n2. The inner width is calculated in a similar manner:\n   - Outer width = 6 inches\n   - Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches\n\n3. The inner height is calculated as:\n   - Outer height = 4 inches\n   - Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches\n\nNow that we have the inner dimensions of one box as 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches, we can calculate the volume of one box using the formula for volume (length × width × height):\n\n- Volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.\n\nSince John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume:\n\n- Total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 3 boxes × 24 cubic inches/box = 72 cubic inches.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n- Inner dimensions for one box are 3 inches (length) × 4 inches (width) × 2 inches (height).\n- Volume of one box calculation: 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 cubic inches.\n- Total for 3 boxes: 3 × 24 = 72 cubic inches.\n\nEverything checks out, so we have the correct total inner volume.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 72 cubic inches \\n#### 72",
