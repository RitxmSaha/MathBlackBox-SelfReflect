        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem, we first need to determine the total time the candle burns between the given times. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours (from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 5). Next, since the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can calculate the total amount it will melt during those 4 hours by multiplying the rate of melting (2 cm/hour) by the total time (4 hours). \n\nCalculation: \n2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm\n\nThus, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning for that period.\n\n[Verification] Let's confirm the calculations:\n- Time interval: 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is indeed 4 hours.\n- Melting rate: 2 cm/hour.\n- Total melting: 4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm.\n\nBoth steps are consistent with our initial calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
