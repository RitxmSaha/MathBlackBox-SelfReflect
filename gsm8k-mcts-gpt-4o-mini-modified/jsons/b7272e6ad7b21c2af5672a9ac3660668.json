        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is now 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before her, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:\n\nRaymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years\nRaymond's age = 31 + 6\nRaymond's age = 37 years old.\n\nNext, we know that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age when he had his son from his current age:\n\nYears since son was born = Raymond's current age - Age at which he had his son\nYears since son was born = 37 - 23\nYears since son was born = 14 years ago.\n\n[Verification] We found that Raymond is currently 37 years old and that his son was born when he was 23. Therefore, in the 14 years since then, Raymond has aged from 23 to 37, confirming our calculation. Thus, Raymond's son was indeed born 14 years ago.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14 \\n#### 14",
