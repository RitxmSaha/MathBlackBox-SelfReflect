        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the information given. \n\n1. John spent $200 on blue ties. We know that each blue tie costs $40. Therefore, we can calculate how many blue ties he bought:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue ties} = \\frac{\\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \\frac{200}{40} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we first calculate 50% of the blue tie price:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Extra cost} = 0.5 \\times 40 = 20\n   \\]\n   Hence, the cost of each red tie is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per red tie} = \\text{Cost per blue tie} + \\text{Extra cost} = 40 + 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n4.

Finally, we need to find the total amount John spent on all the ties:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spent on all ties} = \\text{Total spent on blue ties} + \\text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n- John bought 5 blue ties at $40 each, totaling $200.\n- He bought 10 red ties at $60 each, totaling $600.\n- The total amount spent on ties is indeed $200 + $600 = $800.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 800 \\n#### 800",
