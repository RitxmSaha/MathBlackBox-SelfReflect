        "[Reasoning process] Start by determining how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate James's sleep time as follows: \n\nJames’s sleep = (2/3) * Harry’s sleep \n= (2/3) * 9 hours \n= 6 hours.\n\nNext, we find the difference in sleep hours between Harry and James:\n\nDifference = Harry’s sleep - James’s sleep \n= 9 hours - 6 hours \n= 3 hours.\n\nNow we have determined that Harry slept 3 hours more than James.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculation is correct, let’s recheck the steps: \n1. We calculated James’s sleep time correctly: (2/3) of 9 hours equals 6 hours.\n2. The difference calculated is also consistent: 9 hours (Harry) minus 6 hours (James) equals 3 hours.\n\nThus, both the individual components and the final calculation confirm that the difference is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 hours. \\n#### 3",
