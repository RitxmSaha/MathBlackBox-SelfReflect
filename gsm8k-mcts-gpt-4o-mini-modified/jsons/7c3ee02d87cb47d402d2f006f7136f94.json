        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much water the two girls received. Each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters. We can calculate that amount by multiplying:\n\n1/6 × 24 = 4 liters per girl.\n\nSince there are two girls, we now multiply this amount by 2 to find the total amount of water they both received:\n\n4 liters/girl × 2 girls = 8 liters.\n\nNext, we consider the amount of water the boy received, which is given as 6 liters. We now add the total water received by the girls and the boy:\n\nTotal water received = water by girls + water by boy = 8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters.\n\nNow we can find out how much water is left. We subtract the total water received from the initial amount of water:\n\n24 liters (initial) - 14 liters (total received) = 10 liters.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations: \n- Each girl got 4 liters, totaling 8 liters for both.\n- The boy received 6 liters, so adding these together gives us 14 liters received by both girls and the boy.\n- Subtracting 14 liters from the initial 24 liters indeed gives 10 liters left.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 liters.  \n#### 10",
