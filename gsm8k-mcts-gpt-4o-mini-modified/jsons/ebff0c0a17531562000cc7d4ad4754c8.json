        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine the total number of people sent by the four schools to the basketball tournament, we need to account for the following:\n\n1. **Teams sent by each school**: Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team. This means that for each school, there are:\n   - 1 Girls' Basketball Team\n   - 1 Boys' Basketball Team\n\n   Since there are 4 schools, the total number of teams is:\n   - Total Teams = 4 schools * 2 teams (1 girls’ + 1 boys’) = 8 teams\n\n2. **Players in each team**: Each basketball team consists of 5 players. Therefore, the total number of players across all teams is:\n   - Total Players = 8 teams * 5 players/team = 40 players\n\n3. **Coaches for each team**: Each team has a coach. Since there are 8 teams, the total number of coaches is:\n   - Total Coaches = 8 teams * 1 coach/team = 8 coaches\n\n4. **Total people sent**: Finally, the total number of people sent by the schools can be found by adding the total number of players and coaches:\n   - Total People = Total Players + Total Coaches = 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify this step-by-step:\n- Number of teams: 4 schools * 2 teams/school = 8 teams → correct.\n- Number of players: 8 teams * 5 players/team = 40 players → correct.\n- Number of coaches: 8 teams * 1 coach/team = 8 coaches → correct.\n- Adding them up: 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people → correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
