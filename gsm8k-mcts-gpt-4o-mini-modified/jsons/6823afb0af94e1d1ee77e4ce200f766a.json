        "[reasoning process] To begin with, we know there are 200 Grade 5 students. We need to determine how many of them are boys and girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 200 = 80\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120\n\\]\n\nNext, we have the information that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.

We then found that the remaining number of girls, which is the total number of girls (120) minus those in the girl scout (80), is indeed 40. \n\nThus, the calculations hold true, and the number of girls not in the girl scout is correctly determined.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \\n#### 40",
