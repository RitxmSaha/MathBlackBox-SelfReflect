        "[reasoning process] \nJanet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs each day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins, which totals to 3 + 4 = 7 eggs consumed daily. To find out how many eggs she has left to sell, we subtract the number of eggs she consumes from the total number of eggs laid: \n\n16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs consumed) = 9 eggs remaining for sale.\n\nNext, Janet sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. Therefore, to find out how much money she makes from selling the eggs, we multiply the number of eggs remaining by the price per egg:\n\n9 (eggs) × $2 (per egg) = $18.\n\n[Verification]\nWe confirmed the number of eggs Janet consumes and the total eggs laid correctly: 3 for breakfast and 4 for baking equals 7. The remaining eggs for sale were calculated as 16 - 7 = 9. Selling those at $2 each gives us the earnings of 9 × $2 = $18.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18 \\n#### 18",
