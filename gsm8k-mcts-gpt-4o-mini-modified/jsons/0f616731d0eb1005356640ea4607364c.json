The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?",
    "ground_truth": "The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.\nThe third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times the third time.\nIn all, Greg’s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.\n#### 22",

        "[reasoning process] \n1. Start by analyzing the first time the alarm went off. The problem states that it rang 4 times.\n2. Next, for the second time the alarm went off, it rang for 3 times as long as the first time. Since the first time it rang 4 times, we multiply that by 3:\n   - Second time: 4 (first time) * 3 = 12 rings.\n3. Then, for the third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. We take the number of rings from the second time and divide it by 2:\n   - Third time: 12 (second time) / 2 = 6 rings.\n4. Now, we add up all the rings from each occurrence of the alarm:\n   - Total rings = 4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 rings.\n\n[Verification] \n- First time: 4 rings.\n- Second time: 12 rings (which is indeed 3 times 4).\n- Third time: 6 rings (which is half of 12).\n- Adding them together confirms our calculations: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 22 \n#### 22",
