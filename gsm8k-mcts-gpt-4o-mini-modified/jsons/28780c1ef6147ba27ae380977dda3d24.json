    "ground_truth": "First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB\nThen divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes\nThen find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes\nThen add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes\n#### 160",
